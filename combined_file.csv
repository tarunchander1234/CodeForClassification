ID:30872385|Title:Comparison of methodologies for the detection of BRAF mutations in bone marrow trephine specimens.Abstract:AIMS: BRAF V600E detection assists in the diagnosis of hairy cell leukaemia (HCL); however, testing practices vary. We evaluated the clinical utility of 5 BRAF mutation testing strategies for use on bone marrow trephines (BMT). METHODS: 11 HCL, 5 HCL 'mimic', 2 treated HCL and 10 normal BMT specimens were tested for mutant BRAF, comparing Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, amplicon-based next generation sequencing (NGS), automated (Idylla) PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: PCR and IHC were cheaper and identified V600E in 100 % of HCL cases. Pyrosequencing detected the mutation in 91%, NGS in 55% of cases and Sanger sequencing in 27%. All assays gave wild-type BRAF results in HCL mimics and normal BMT samples. CONCLUSIONS: PCR and IHC were most sensitive and cost-effective, but these have limited scope for multiplexing and are likely to be replaced by NGS gene panels or whole genome sequencing in the medium to long term.|Cancer
ID:30873683|Title:Tumour biomarkers-Tracing the molecular function and clinical implication.Abstract:In recent years, with the increase in cancer mortality caused by metastasis, and with the development of individualized and precise medical treatment, early diagnosis with precision becomes the key to decrease the death rate. Since detecting tumour biomarkers in body fluids is the most non-invasive way to identify the status of tumour development, it has been widely investigated for the usage in clinic. These biomarkers include different expression or mutation in microRNAs (miRNAs), circulating tumour DNAs (ctDNAs), proteins, exosomes and circulating tumour cells (CTCs). In the present article, we summarized and discussed some updated research on these biomarkers. We overviewed their biological functions and evaluated their multiple roles in human and small animal clinical treatment, including diagnosis of cancers, classification of cancers, prognostic and predictive values for therapy response, monitors for therapy efficacy, and anti-cancer therapeutics. Biomarkers including different expression or mutation in miRNAs, ctDNAs, proteins, exosomes and CTCs provide more choice for early diagnosis of tumour detection at early stage before metastasis. Combination detection of these tumour biomarkers may provide higher accuracy at the lowest molecule combination number for tumour early detection. Moreover, tumour biomarkers can provide valuable suggestions for clinical anti-cancer treatment and execute monitoring of treatment efficiency.|Cancer
ID:30874851|Title:Pomalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients in a real-life setting: a single-center retrospective study.Abstract:Pomalidomide dexamethasone is a standard of care for relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) patients who received at least two prior lines of therapy, including both lenalidomide and proteasome inhibitors (PI). We report here a real-life single-center series of 49 consecutive patients with relapsed and refractory MM treated with the triplet pomalidomide cyclophosphamide dexamethasone (PCD) combination. The median of prior lines of therapy was 3 and all patients were previously exposed to proteasome inhibitors and lenalidomide. The overall response rate was 76%, including 27% very good partial response or better. With a median follow-up of 16 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.3 months and the median overall survival was not reached. Regarding safety, most frequent toxicity was hematologic, including 37% grade 3-4 cytopenias. Nine patients (18%) discontinued therapy due to adverse event. Our study confirms that PCD combination is feasible and results in favorable response rate and PFS in comparison with pomalidomide dexamethasone alone.|Cancer
ID:30875581|Title:Aggressive variants of prostate cancer - Are we ready to apply specific treatment right now?Abstract:Recently, adoption of novel drugs for systemic treatment of metastatic prostate cancer has led to a striking improvement of response rate and survival in both hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant disease. In most cases, prostate cancer essentially depends on androgen receptor signaling axis, even in castration-resistant setting, and hence may be targeted by second generation hormonal therapy. However, a subset of patients bears androgen-independent cancer biology with a short-term response to hormonal treatment, early and extensive visceral metastases, low PSA levels and poor outcomes. Identification and specific management of these rapidly fatal malignancies is of an unmet medical need since their classification and utilized therapeutic regimens vary significantly. Unfortunately, molecular pathways have not been sufficiently elucidated yet in order to provide an effective targeted treatment with a prolonged response. Lack of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for these cancers makes successful counteractions against them even more sophisticated. In this comprehensive review, we aimed at summarizing the current body of literature reporting on causal molecular machinery as well as diagnostic and therapeutic concepts of aggressive prostate tumors and draw clinically relevant conclusions for the up-to-date sensible disease management.|Cancer
ID:30875950|Title:Circulating Tumour Cells (CTC), Head and Neck Cancer and Radiotherapy; Future Perspectives.Abstract:Head and neck cancer is the seventh most common cancer in Australia and globally. Despite the current improved treatment modalities, there is still up to 50-60% local regional recurrence and or distant metastasis. High-resolution medical imaging technologies such as PET/CT and MRI do not currently detect the early spread of tumour cells, thus limiting the potential for effective minimal residual detection and early diagnosis. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) are a rare subset of cells that escape from the primary tumour and enter into the bloodstream to form metastatic deposits or even re-establish themselves in the primary site of the cancer. These cells are more aggressive and accumulate gene alterations by somatic mutations that are the same or even greater than the primary tumour because of additional features acquired in the circulation. The potential application of CTC in clinical use is to acquire a liquid biopsy, by taking a reliable minimally invasive venous blood sample, for cell genotyping during radiotherapy treatment to monitor the decline in CTC detectability, and mutational changes in response to radiation resistance and radiation sensitivity. Currently, very little has been published on radiation therapy, CTC, and circulating cancer stem cells (CCSCs). The prognostic value of CTC in cancer management and personalised medicine for head and neck cancer radiotherapy patients requires a deeper understanding at the cellular level, along with other advanced technologies. With this goal, this review summarises the current research of head and neck cancer CTC, CCSC and the molecular targets for personalised radiotherapy response.|Cancer
ID:30878128|Title:ALK rearrangements: Biology, detection and opportunities of therapy in non-small cell lung cancer.Abstract:The ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) gene encodes a transmembrane protein rearranged in 2-7% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. This gene has become the second most studied therapeutic target after EGFR due to the implied therapeutic opportunities. While the diagnostic of ALK rearrangements is well established, small molecules targeting ALK are in constant evolution because tumor cells eventually will develop mechanisms of resistance. In this review we describe the biology of the ALK gene, alterations, epidemiology, diagnostic tests as well as strategies of treatment.|Cancer
ID:30878469|Title:AGA Clinical Practice Update on Interaction Between Oral Direct-Acting Antivirals for Chronic Hepatitis C Infection and Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Expert Review.Abstract:DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this clinical practice update is to evaluate the evidence describing the interaction between direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with regard to HCC incidence, HCC recurrence, and DAA efficacy, and to summarize best practice advice regarding HCC surveillance and timing of DAA therapy. METHODS: The recommendations outlined in this expert review are based on available published evidence, including observational studies and systematic reviews, and incorporates expert opinion where applicable. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: DAA treatment is associated with a reduction in the risk of incident HCC. The relative risk reduction is similar in patients with and without cirrhosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with advanced liver fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis should receive surveillance imaging before initiating DAA treatment. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with advanced liver fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis at the time of DAA treatment represent the highest-risk group for HCC after DAA-induced sustained virologic response. These patients should stay in HCC surveillance. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: HCC surveillance should be performed using ultrasound with or without alpha-fetoprotein every 6 months. Current data do not support shorter surveillance intervals or the use of alternative surveillance modalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Future studies may show a reduction in HCC risk over time after DAA-induced sustained virologic response. However, in the interim, HCC surveillance should continue indefinitely if patients are otherwise eligible for potentially curative therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: The presence of active HCC is associated with a small but statistically significant decrease in sustained virologic response with DAA therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Patients with HCC who are eligible for potentially curative therapy with liver resection or ablation should defer DAA therapy until after HCC treatment is completed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Timing of DAA therapy for patients with HCC who are listed for liver transplantation should be determined with consideration of median wait times, availability of hepatitis C virus-positive organs, and degree of liver dysfunction. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: There are insufficient data evaluating benefits and cost-effectiveness of DAA therapy in patients with active intermediate or advanced HCC. Decisions regarding DAA treatment in these patients should be considered in light of HCC tumor burden, degree of liver dysfunction, life expectancy, and patient preferences. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: There are no conclusive data that DAA therapy is associated with increased or decreased risk, differential time to recurrence, or aggressiveness of recurrent HCC in patients with complete response to HCC therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: DAA therapy should not be withheld from patients with complete response to HCC therapy; however, DAA therapy can be deferred 4-6 months to confirm response to HCC therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Patients with complete response to HCC therapy who are treated with DAAs have a continued risk of HCC recurrence and require HCC surveillance, which should be conducted indefinitely with dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging every 3-6 months. Current data do not support more frequent surveillance in these patients. This Clinical Practice Update was produced by the AGA Institute.|Cancer
ID:30878600|Title:Concurrent Driver Gene Mutations as Negative Predictive Factors in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are clinically effective in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbouring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) oncogene mutations. Genetic factors, other than EGFR sensitive mutations, that allow prognosis of TKI treatment remain undefined. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 423 consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR 19del or 21L858R mutations. A total of 71 patients whose progression-free survivals (PFS) were shorter than 6 months or longer than 24 months were included and stratified into separate groups. Genetic background discrepancy was analysed in the two groups using next generation sequencing (NGS). FINDINGS: Sensitive EGFR mutations of 19del or 21L858R were detected by NGS in all patients; the 21L858R mutation was the major type. The most frequent accompanying somatic mutations were TP53, RB1, MAP2K. ALK fusion, MET amplification, and BRAF V600E were found only in the short PFS group. Concurrent pretreament T790 M mutation was found in both groups, but was proportionally higher in the short PFS group. In the short PFS group, patients had significantly more driver gene mutations than in long PFS group (P = 0 018). The numbers of concomitant somatic mutations, EGFR pathway-related mutations, and tumor mutation burden (TMB) were not significantly different between the two groups. INTERPRETATION: Co-occuring driver gene mutations were negative predictive factors of TKI therapy in EGFR-mutated patients. This study highlights the importance of exploring co-occuring genomic alterations before initiation of EGFR-TKIs.|Cancer
ID:30879681|Title:Inhibition of tumor growth by beta-glucans through promoting CD4+ T cell immunomodulation and neutrophil-killing in mice.Abstract:beta-glucans are polysaccharides comprising beta-D-glucoses with various bioactivities. Herein, we extracted three beta-glucans from Lentinus edodes with different sources and assessed their antitumor activities on a mice model with intragastric, intraperitoneal and intratumoral injection. Three polysaccharides were shown to have the same chemical structure of beta-(1,3)-glucan with beta-(1,6) branches, and exhibited S-180 tumor-suppressing ability with good safety. It was found that beta-glucans up-regulated CD4+ T cell level in lymphoid organs decreased by tumor-burden, indicating promotion of immunomodulation. beta-glucans targeted tumors in vivo even after oral or intraperitoneal injection. Furthermore, beta-glucans not only targeted to lymphoid organs and increased CD4+ T cells number, but also enhanced CD4+ T cells and neutrophils populations in tumors. It was proposed that beta-glucans promoted CD4+ T cell immunomodulation and neutrophils infiltration into tumors, leading to tumor growth inhibition. These findings reveal that beta-glucans can be used as an effective agent for cancer immunotherapy.|Cancer
ID:30880225|Title:A comprehensive study of epigenetic alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma identifies potential therapeutic targets.Abstract:BACKGROUND & AIMS: A causal link has recently been established between epigenetic alterations and hepatocarcinogenesis, indicating that epigenetic inhibition may have therapeutic potential. We aimed to identify and target epigenetic modifiers that show molecular alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We studied the molecular-clinical correlations of epigenetic modifiers including bromodomains, histone acetyltransferases, lysine methyltransferases and lysine demethylases in HCC using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data of 365 patients with HCC. The therapeutic potential of epigenetic inhibitors was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing analysis and its correlation with expression and clinical data in the TCGA dataset were used to identify expression programs normalized by Jumonji lysine demethylase (JmjC) inhibitors. RESULTS: Genetic alterations, aberrant expression, and correlation between tumor expression and poor patient prognosis of epigenetic enzymes are common events in HCC. Epigenetic inhibitors that target bromodomain (JQ-1), lysine methyltransferases (BIX-1294 and LLY-507) and JmjC lysine demethylases (JIB-04, GSK-J4 and SD-70) reduce HCC aggressiveness. The pan-JmjC inhibitor JIB-04 had a potent antitumor effect in tumor bearing mice. HCC cells treated with JmjC inhibitors showed overlapping changes in expression programs related with inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell death. JmjC inhibition reverses an aggressive HCC gene expression program that is also altered in patients with HCC. Several genes downregulated by JmjC inhibitors are highly expressed in tumor vs. non-tumor parenchyma, and their high expression correlates with a poor prognosis. We identified and validated a 4-gene expression prognostic signature consisting of CENPA, KIF20A, PLK1, and NCAPG. CONCLUSIONS: The epigenetic alterations identified in HCC can be used to predict prognosis and to define a subgroup of high-risk patients that would potentially benefit from JmjC inhibitor therapy. LAY SUMMARY: In this study, we found that mutations and changes in expression of epigenetic modifiers are common events in human hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to an aggressive gene expression program and poor clinical prognosis. The transcriptional program can be reversed by pharmacological inhibition of Jumonji enzymes. This inhibition blocks hepatocellular carcinoma progression, providing a novel potential therapeutic strategy.|Cancer
ID:30882153|Title:The single-base-pair deletion, MSH2 c.2635-3delC affecting intron 15 splicing can be a cause of Lynch syndrome.Abstract:The proband was a 62-year-old man with ureter cancer. He had a history of metachronous colorectal and gastric cancer. Immunohistochemical staining showed the absence of both MSH2 and MSH6 proteins in the ureter cancer and other available cancer tissue specimens. Genetic testing was conducted to identify the causative genes of hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes including mismatch repair genes. We detected a germline variant, c.2635-3delC, within the splice acceptor site of exon 16, in the MSH2 gene. To investigate whether this variant affected splicing of the gene, RNA sequencing was performed using blood samples. We observed a substantial amount of the transcripts that lacked proper splicing of intron 15 in the indexed case, whereas, a very low amount of such aberrant transcripts was detected in the controls, strongly indicating an association between the variant and splicing defect. These results indicate that MSH2 c.2635-3delC affects normal splicing and might be a cause of Lynch syndrome.|Cancer
ID:30883505|Title:Circulating Cell-Free DNA-Diagnostic and Prognostic Applications in Personalized Cancer Therapy.Abstract:Genomic analyses in oncologic care allow for the development of more precise clinical laboratory tests that will be critical for personalized pharmacotherapy. Traditional biopsy-based approaches are limited by the availability of sequential tissue specimens to detect resistance. Blood-based genomic profiling ("liquid biopsy") is useful for longitudinal monitoring of tumor genomes and can complement biopsies. Tumor-associated mutations can be identified in cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patient blood samples and used for monitoring disease activity. The US Food and Drug Administration approved a liquid biopsy test for EGFR-activating mutations in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer as a companion diagnostic for therapy selection. ctDNA also allows for the identification of mutations selected by treatment such as EGFR T790M in non-small-cell lung cancer. ctDNA can also detect mutations such as KRAS G12V in colorectal cancer and BRAF V600E/V600K in melanoma. Chromosomal aberration pattern analysis by low-coverage whole genome sequencing is a new, broader approach. Genomic imbalances detected in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can be used to compute a copy number instability (CNI) score. In clinical studies, it was demonstrated that the change in CNI score can serve as an early predictor of therapeutic response to chemotherapy/immunotherapy of many cancer types. In multivariable models, it could be shown that the CNI score was superior to clinical parameters for prediction of overall survival in patients with head and neck cancer. There is emerging evidence for the clinical validity of ctDNA testing regarding identification of candidates for targeted therapies, prediction of therapeutic response, early detection of recurrence, resistance mutation detection, measuring genetic heterogeneity, tumor burden monitoring, and risk stratification. Improvement of sensitivity to detect tumors at very early stages is difficult due to insufficient mutant DNA fraction of <=0.01%. Further developments will include validation in prospective multicenter interventional outcome studies and the development of digital platforms to integrate diagnostic data.|Cancer
ID:30884806|Title:Telomeres and Telomerase in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma.Abstract:The role of telomere biology and telomerase activation in skin cancers has been investigated in melanoma and basal cell carcinoma but limited evidence is available for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). We will review the current knowledge on the role of telomere and telomerase pathway in cSCC pathogenesis. At the somatic level, both long and short telomere lengths have been described in cSCC. This telomere dichotomy is probably related to two different mechanisms of tumour initiation which determines two tumour subtypes. Telomere shortening is observed during the invasive progression from in situ forms of cSCC, such as Bowen's disease (BD) and actinic keratosis (AK), to invasive cSCC. At the germline level, controversial results have been reported on the association between constitutive telomere length and risk of cSCC. Approximately 75-85% of cSCC tumours are characterized by a high level of telomerase activity. Telomerase activation has been also reported in AKs and BD and in sun-damaged skin, thus supporting the hypothesis that UV modulates telomerase activity in the skin. Activating TERT promoter mutations have been identified in 32-70% of cSCCs, with the majority showing the UV-signature. No significant correlation was observed between TERT promoter mutations and cSCC clinico-pathological features. However, TERT promoter mutations have been recently suggested to be independent predictors of an adverse outcome. The attention on telomere biology and telomerase activity in cSCC is increasing for the potential implications in the development of effective tools for prognostic assessment and of therapeutic strategies in patients with cutaneous cSCC.|Cancer
ID:30884810|Title:PFKFB2 Promoter Hypomethylation as Recurrence Predictive Marker in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Carcinomas.Abstract:Despite the low mortality rates, well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (WDTC) frequently relapse. BRAF and TERT mutations have been extensively related to prognosis in thyroid cancer. In this study, the methylation levels of selected CpGs (5-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3) comprising a classifier, previously reported by our group, were assessed in combination with BRAF and TERT mutations. We evaluated 121 WDTC, three poorly-differentiated/anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (PDTC/ATC), 22 benign thyroid lesions (BTL), and 13 non-neoplastic thyroid (NT) tissues. BRAF (V600E) and TERT promoter (C228T and C250T) mutations were tested by pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing, respectively. Three CpGs mapped in PFKFB2, ATP6V0C, and CXXC5 were evaluated by bisulfite pyrosequencing. ATP6V0C hypermethylation and PFKFB2 hypomethylation were detected in poor-prognosis (PDTC/ATC and relapsed WDTC) compared with good-prognosis (no relapsed WDTC) and non-malignant cases (NT/BTL). CXXC5 was hypomethylated in both poor and good-prognosis cases. Shorter disease-free survival was observed in WDTC patients presenting lower PFKFB2 methylation levels (p = 0.004). No association was observed on comparing BRAF (60.7%) and TERT (3.4%) mutations and prognosis. Lower PFKFB2 methylation levels was an independent factor of high relapse risk (Hazard Ratio = 3.2; CI95% = 1.1-9.5). PFKFB2 promoter methylation analysis has potential applicability to better stratify WDTC patients according to the recurrence risk, independently of BRAF and TERT mutations.|Cancer
ID:30885150|Title:The small molecule Bcl-2/Mcl-1 inhibitor TW-37 shows single-agent cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma cell lines.Abstract:BACKGROUND: High-risk neuroblastoma with N-Myc amplification remains a therapeutic challenge in paediatric oncology. Antagonism of pro-death Bcl-2 homology (BH) proteins to pro-survival BH members such as Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 has become a treatment approach, but previous studies suggest that a combined inhibition of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 is necessary. TW-37 inhibits Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 with almost the same affinity. However, single-agent cytotoxicity of TW-37 in neuroblastoma cell lines has not been investigated. METHODS: Cell viability, apoptosis, proliferation and changes in growth properties were determined in SKNAS, IMR-5, SY5Y and Kelly cells after treatment with TW-37. After transfection with Mcl-1 or Bcl-2 siRNA, apoptosis and proliferation were investigated in Kelly cells. Mice with Kelly cell line xenografts were treated with TW-37 and tumor growth, survival and apoptosis were determined. RESULTS: Cell lines with N-Myc amplification were more sensitive to TW-37 treatment, IC50 values for IMR-5 and Kelly cells being 0.28 muM and 0.22 muM, compared to SY5Y cells and SKNAS cells (IC50 0.96 muM and 0.83 muM). Treatment with TW-37 resulted in increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation rates, especially in IMR5 and Kelly cells. Bcl-2 as well as Mcl-1 knockdown induced apoptosis in Kelly cells. TW-37 led to a decrease in tumor growth and a favorable survival (p = 0.0379) in a Kelly neuroblastoma xenografts mouse model. CONCLUSION: TW-37 has strong single-agent cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, combined inhibition of Bcl-2/Mcl-1 by TW-37 in N-Myc amplified neuroblastoma may represent an interesting therapeutic strategy.|Cancer
ID:30885334|Title:A study of ALK-positive pulmonary squamous-cell carcinoma: From diagnostic methodologies to clinical efficacy.Abstract:BACKGROUND: High concordance has been observed between Ventana D5F3 ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) in lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). However, whether a similar conclusion can be applied to lung squamous-cell carcinoma (LSCC) has remained unclear. We therefore evaluated the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) status and the therapeutic effect of an ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in IHC- or FISH-positive LSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2403 LSCC patients from three institutions were screened for ALK aberration by IHC. All IHC-positive cases were subjected to FISH (with an approximately equal number of negative cases as a control group) and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Clinical efficacy was evaluated for the patients who received TKI therapy. RESULTS: In 2403 cases of LSCC, 37 cases were identified as ALK-positive by IHC. After quality control, 28 cases were succeeded by FISH (six with insufficient tissue, three with lack of signals) and 13 by NGS (24 failed due to insufficient samples or poor DNA quality); the percentage of non-diagnostic tests was 24.3% (9/37) and 64.9% (24/37), respectively. Four cases (4/2394, 0.17%) analyzed by FISH were determined as ALK-positive. For the control group (40 ALK IHC), FISH demonstrated no samples with ALK gene fusion. The concordance between ALK IHC- and ALK FISH-positive results was 14.3% (4/28). In the 13 cases studied by NGS, two cases showed ALK-EML4 fusion (consistent with two FISH-positive results), and two cases were interpreted as harboring an ALK-association gene mutation. Among four patients (two FISH-positive and two IHC-positive only cases) receiving TKI therapy, two patients had stable disease and the other two had progressive disease. CONCLUSIONS: The positive concordance rate of ALK IHC and FISH in LSCC is far less than that reported for LADC. Therefore, ALK IHC detection in LSCC cannot be used as a diagnostic method for ALK rearrangement.|Cancer
ID:30886395|Title:Immunotherapy in colorectal cancer: rationale, challenges and potential.Abstract:Following initial successes in melanoma treatment, immunotherapy has rapidly become established as a major treatment modality for multiple types of solid cancers, including a subset of colorectal cancers (CRCs). Two programmed cell death 1 (PD1)-blocking antibodies, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, have shown efficacy in patients with metastatic CRC that is mismatch-repair-deficient and microsatellite instability-high (dMMR-MSI-H), and have been granted accelerated FDA approval. In contrast to most other treatments for metastatic cancer, immunotherapy achieves long-term durable remission in a subset of patients, highlighting the tremendous promise of immunotherapy in treating dMMR-MSI-H metastatic CRC. Here, we review the clinical development of immune checkpoint inhibition in CRC leading to regulatory approvals for the treatment of dMMR-MSI-H CRC. We focus on new advances in expanding the efficacy of immunotherapy to early-stage CRC and CRC that is mismatch-repair-proficient and has low microsatellite instability (pMMR-MSI-L) and discuss emerging approaches for targeting the immune microenvironment, which might complement immune checkpoint inhibition.|Cancer
ID:30887763|Title:Immunotherapy in endometrial cancer: new scenarios on the horizon.Abstract:This extensive review summarizes clinical evidence on immunotherapy and targeted therapy currently available for endometrial cancer (EC) and reports the results of the clinical trials and ongoing studies. The research was carried out collecting preclinical and clinical findings using keywords such as immune environment, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and others' on PubMed. Finally, we looked for the ongoing immunotherapy trials on ClinicalTrials.gov. EC is the fourth most common malignancy in women in developed countries. Despite medical and surgical treatments, survival has not improved in the last decade and death rates have increased for uterine cancer in women. Therefore, identification of clinically significant prognostic risk factors and formulation of new rational therapeutic regimens have great significance for enhancing the survival rate and improving the outcome in patients with advanced or metastatic disease. The identification of genetic alterations, including somatic mutations and microsatellite instability, and the definition of intracellular signaling pathways alterations that have a major role in in tumorigenesis is leading to the development of new therapeutic options for immunotherapy and targeted therapy.|Cancer
ID:30888062|Title:Two novel variants in the ATM gene causing ataxia-telangiectasia, including a duplication of 90 kb: Utility of targeted next-generation sequencing in detection of copy number variation.Abstract:Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, ocular apraxia, immunodeficiency, telangiectasia, elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration, radiosensitivity and cancer predisposition. Classical A-T is caused by biallelic variants on ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene, leading to a loss of function of the protein kinase ATM, involved in DNA damage repair. Atypical presentations can be found in A-T-like disease or in Nijmegen breakage syndrome, caused by deficiency of mre11 or nibrin proteins, respectively. In this report, we present the genetic characterization of a 4-year-old female with clinical diagnosis of A-T. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed two novel heterozygous mutations in the ATM gene: a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) at exon 47 (NM_000051.3:c.6899G > C; p.Trp2300Ser) and ~90 kb genomic duplication spanning exons 17-61, NG_009830.1:g.(41245_49339)_(137044_147250)dup. These findings were validated by Sanger sequencing and MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) analysis respectively. Familial segregation study confirmed that the two variants are inherited, and the infant is a compound heterozygote. Thus, our study expands the spectrum of ATM pathogenic variants and demonstrates the utility of targeted NGS in the detection of copy number variation.|Cancer
ID:30889379|Title:The Proteogenomic Landscape of Curable Prostate Cancer.Abstract:DNA sequencing has identified recurrent mutations that drive the aggressiveness of prostate cancers. Surprisingly, the influence of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic dysregulation on the tumor proteome remains poorly understood. We profiled the genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes of 76 localized, intermediate-risk prostate cancers. We discovered that the genomic subtypes of prostate cancer converge on five proteomic subtypes, with distinct clinical trajectories. ETS fusions, the most common alteration in prostate tumors, affect different genes and pathways in the proteome and transcriptome. Globally, mRNA abundance changes explain only ~10% of protein abundance variability. As a result, prognostic biomarkers combining genomic or epigenomic features with proteomic ones significantly outperform biomarkers comprised of a single data type.|Cancer
ID:30890403|Title:BRAF V600E mutation and microRNAs are helpful in distinguishing papillary thyroid malignant lesions: Tissues and fine needle aspiration cytology cases.Abstract:AIMS: Mutations of BRAF oncogene are considered to contribute in the invasiveness and poor clinicopathologic features of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). As a step towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of this contribution, we aimed to examine the association of four microRNAs' (miR-222, -137, -214, -181b) levels with BRAFV600E and clinicopathological features in PTC tissues and fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens. METHODS: In total, 56 PTC and 27 benign with multinodular goiter tissue samples, 95 FNA samples, and B-CPAP and HEK293 cell lines were examined. BRAFV600E mutation was examined in PTC tissues and FNA samples. Expression of microRNAs was assessed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. KEY FINDINGS: The frequency of BRAFV600E in PTC tissues and FNA samples "suspicious for PTC" was 41.1 and 36.8%, respectively. MiR-222, -137, -214, and -181b were significantly upregulated in PTC tumors (P < 0.05) and in B-CPAP cell line (P < 0.001). In FNA, the expressions of miR-222, -181b and -214 were significantly elevated in patients suspected for PTC (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference in miR-137. After adjustment for age and sex, miR-181b was associated with an increased risk of bearing BRAFV600E mutation (OR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.01-1.61; P = 0.045) and risk of lymphovascular invasion (OR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.01-2.72; P = 0.045); miR-137 was associated with the risk of larger tumor size (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.04-1.65; P = 0.022); miR-222 was related to increase in extracapsular invasion (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.04-1.57; P = 0.018). SIGNIFICANCE: Upregulation of miR-222, -214 and -181b has been confirmed in PTC tumors, FNA samples and cell line. MiR-137 upregulation has been confirmed in PTC tumors and cell line, but not in FNA samples. MiR-222, -137 and -181b showed an association with the degree of malignancy in PTC tumors.|Cancer
ID:30893213|Title:Measurement of 18F-FDG PET tumor heterogeneity improves early assessment of response to bevacizumab compared with the standard size and uptake metrics in a colorectal cancer model.Abstract:PURPOSE: Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer frequently includes antiangiogenic agents such as bevacizumab. Size measurements are inadequate to assess treatment response to these agents, and newer response assessment criteria are needed. We aimed to evaluate F-FDG PET-derived texture parameters in a preclinical colorectal cancer model as alternative metrics of response to treatment with bevacizumab. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen CD1 athymic mice injected in the flank with 5x106 LS174T cells (human colorectal carcinoma) were either untreated controls (n=7) or bevacizumab treated (n=7). After 2 weeks, mice underwent F-FDG PET/CT. Calliper-measured tumor growth (Deltavol) and final tumor volume (Volcal), F-FDG PET metabolically active volume (Volmet), mean metabolism (Metmean), and maximum metabolism (Metmax) were measured. Twenty-four texture features were compared between treated and untreated mice. Immunohistochemical mean tumor vascular density was estimated by anti-CD-34 staining after tumor resection. RESULTS: Treated mice had significantly lower tumor vascular density (P=0.032), confirming the antiangiogenic therapeutic effect of bevacizumab. None of the conventional measures were different between the two groups: Deltavol (P=0.9), Volcal (P=0.7), Volmet (P=0.28), Metmax (P=0.7), or Metmean (P=0.32). One texture parameter, GLSZM-SZV (visually indicating that the F-FDG PET images of treated mice comprise uniformly sized clusters of different activity) had significantly different means between the two groups of mice (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: F-FDG PET derived texture parameters, particularly GLSZM-SZV, may be valid biomarkers of tumor response to treatment with bevacizumab, before change in volume.|Cancer
ID:30895378|Title:DNA methylation profiling distinguishes Ewing-like sarcoma with EWSR1-NFATc2 fusion from Ewing sarcoma.Abstract:PURPOSE: Recent studies revealed divergent gene expression patterns in Ewing sarcoma (EwS) with canonical EWSR1-ETS gene fusions and undifferentiated round cell sarcomas (URCS) with EWSR1 rearrangements fused to the non-ETS gene NFATc2. Thus, the question arises whether the latter tumors really belong to EwS. METHODS: We collected five cases matching the group of URCS with EWSR1-NFATc2 fusion and performed DNA methylation and copy number profiling. Results were compared to methylation data of 30 EwS with various EWSR1-ETS fusions and one EwS with FUS-ERG fusion, 16 URCS with CIC rearrangement and 10 URCS with BCOR alteration and a total of 81 EWSR1-associated soft tissue sarcomas including 7 angiomatoid fibrous histiocytomas, 7 clear cell sarcomas of the soft tissue, 28 desmoplastic small round cell tumors, 10 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas and 29 myxoid liposarcomas. RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis of DNA methylation data revealed a homogeneous methylation cluster for URCS with EWSR1-NFATc2 fusion, which clearly segregated from EwS and the other subtypes. Copy number profiles of EWSR1-NFATc2 cases showed recurrent losses on chromosome 9q and segmental gains on 20q13 and 22q12 involving the EWSR1 and NFATc2 loci, respectively. CONCLUSION: In summary, URCS with EWSR1-NFATc2 fusion share a distinct DNA methylation signature and carry characteristic copy number alterations, which emphasizes that these sarcomas should be considered separately from EwS.|Cancer
ID:30895567|Title:Fulminant Essential Thrombocythemia Associated with Acquired Von Willebrand Syndrome and Bleeding Episodes in a 14-year-old Girl.Abstract:BACKGROUND:  Essential thrombocythemia is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm. It is extremely rare in children below 15 years of age with an estimated annual incidence of only 0.09 per million. Usually, clinical symptoms associated with essential thrombocythemia are mild or absent. CASE:  Here, we present the case of a 14-year-old female patient fulminantly presenting with acute symptoms comprising visual impairment, palmar and plantar stabbing pain. Blood count revealed massive thrombocytosis of 2373 x 109/L. Bone marrow morphology showed elevated numbers of mature megakaryocytes. Von Willebrand factor activity/antigen ratio was significantly reduced compatible with an acquired Von Willebrand syndrome associated with high platelet counts. Molecular analyses for driver mutations of myeloproliferative neoplasms including JAK2V617F, CALR and MPL were negative. Acute therapy comprising hyperhydration and oxygen supply complemented by acetylsalicylic acid led to amelioration of symptoms. Medication with hydroxycarbamide maintained a significant reduction of platelet counts but had to be reduced or withheld several times due to neutropenia. Repeated bleeding episodes observed in the course were clearly associated with increases in platelet counts above 1200 x 109/L explained by acquired von Willebrand syndrome. Sixteen months after diagnosis, therapy was switched to pegylated interferon and platelet counts could be stabilized without significant side effects.|Cancer
ID:30896620|Title:Association between KRAS G13D mutations and anastomotic recurrence in colorectal cancer: Two case reports.Abstract:RATIONALE: The prevalence of anastomotic recurrence (AR) in colorectal cancer (CRC) after resection of the primary tumor (PT) is 5% to 14%. However, no association has been observed between specific somatic genetic alterations and AR. Such associations may shed light on the mechanism of AR. PATIENT CONCERNS: We experienced 2 patients with AR of CRC. The first patient was a 42-year-old woman who underwent resection of an AR of rectal cancer 2 times within 19 months after resection of the PT. The second patient was a 77-year-old woman who underwent resection of an AR of ascending colon cancer twice within 38 months after resection of the PT. DIAGNOSIS: Both cases were diagnosed as repetitive AR. INTERVENTIONS: Loss of heterozygosity analysis, microsatellite instability (MSI) study of 9 microsatellite loci, and mutational analysis of KRAS, BRAF, APC, TP53, and SMAD4 were performed. OUTCOMES: All the lesions, except 1, harbored mutations in APC, KRAS, and TP53, without MSI, after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The APC, KRAS, and TP53 mutations were pathogenic or likely pathogenic in the PTs and ARs. Both women harbored the same KRAS G13D mutation, which accounts for 8% of all KRAS mutations in sporadic CRC s. The probability of the incidental occurrence of KRAS G13D mutations in both cases is 0.64%, provided that the mutations were independent of AR. LESSONS: Our findings may shed light on the mechanism of AR in CRC, namely, that the PT harbored the same mutations as the AR and the lesions in both cases harbored the KRAS G13D mutation.|Cancer
ID:30897307|Title:Genotype-phenotype correlation in 99 familial adenomatous polyposis patients: A prospective prevention protocol.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a syndrome caused by germline pathogenic variants in the tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Identification of APC pathogenic variants sites and the genotype-phenotype correlation are important for characterizing, monitoring, and treating members of affected families. The aim of this study was to correlate genotype-phenotype of Brazilian individuals carrying APC pathogenic germline variants and that have FAP. METHODS: The polyposis phenotype of 99 individuals from 35 families between July 2013 and December 2014 were prospectively evaluated based on the InSIGHT polyposis staging classification. Seven extra-colonic manifestations were assessed and the clinical manifestations correlated with the APC genotype. RESULTS: The age of the study participants ranged from 12 to 67 years (median of 29 years). Twenty-six APC pathogenic variants were identified. Fifty-five cases harbored nonsense pathogenic variants (55.6%). Frameshift alterations were noted in 39 cases (39.4%). Aberrant splicing was noted in 1 case (1%). Rearrangements were observed in 3 cases (3%). An association between nonsense variants and rearrangement was noted in 1 case (1%). The genotype-phenotype correlation analysis led the identification of classic FAP in 94 cases (94.9%). Profuse polyposis was identified in 5 cases (5.1%). Thirty-six cases were diagnosed with cancer of which 29 cases (80.6%) were colorectal cancer, 1 case (2.7%) was brain cancer, 4 cases (11.2%) were papillary thyroid cancer, and 2 cases (5.5%) were stomach cancer. The extra-colonic manifestations included 9 individuals with desmoids tumors, 10 with osteomas, and 9 with congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: The genotype-phenotype correlation in Brazilian individuals with FAP revealed specific findings not previously reported for other cohorts, demonstrating the relevance of knowledge regarding the variable pathogenic variants and clinical presentation in different populations for adequate individual clinical management of patients harboring this medical condition.|Cancer
ID:30897768|Title:Breast Cancer and miR-SNPs: The Importance of miR Germ-Line Genetics.Abstract:Recent studies in cancer diagnostics have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) as promising cancer biomarkers. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA binding sites, seed regions, and coding sequences can help predict breast cancer risk, aggressiveness, response to stimuli, and prognosis. This review also documents significant known miR-SNPs in miRNA biogenesis genes and their effects on gene regulation in breast cancer, taking into account the genetic background and ethnicity of the sampled populations. When applicable, miR-SNPs are evaluated in the context of other patient factors, including mutations, hormonal status, and demographics. Given the power of miR-SNPs to predict patient cancer risk, prognosis, and outcomes, further study of miR-SNPs is warranted to improve efforts towards personalized medicine.|Cancer
ID:30898933|Title:High-fructose corn syrup enhances intestinal tumor growth in mice.Abstract:Excessive consumption of beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is associated with obesity and with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Whether HFCS contributes directly to tumorigenesis is unclear. We investigated the effects of daily oral administration of HFCS in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutant mice, which are predisposed to develop intestinal tumors. The HFCS-treated mice showed a substantial increase in tumor size and tumor grade in the absence of obesity and metabolic syndrome. HFCS increased the concentrations of fructose and glucose in the intestinal lumen and serum, respectively, and the tumors transported both sugars. Within the tumors, fructose was converted to fructose-1-phosphate, leading to activation of glycolysis and increased synthesis of fatty acids that support tumor growth. These mouse studies support the hypothesis that the combination of dietary glucose and fructose, even at a moderate dose, can enhance tumorigenesis.|Cancer
ID:30900388|Title:Measurable residual disease monitoring using Wilms tumor gene 1 expression in childhood acute myeloid leukemia based on child-specific reference values.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Measurable/minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring can predict imminent hematological relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The majority of childhood AML patients do not harbor fusion genes or mutations applicable as MRD markers and overexpression of Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) may constitute a useful monitoring target. However, age-specific reference values in healthy hematopoiesis and standardization of WT1 assessment are prerequisites for clinical utility. PROCEDURE: We investigated WT1 expression across age in hematologically healthy controls (n = 109), during suspected infection (n = 90) and bone marrow (BM) regeneration (n = 13). WT1 expression in AML at diagnosis (n = 91) and during follow-up (n = 30) was compared with age-specific reference values. RESULTS: WT1 expression correlated with age and showed higher levels in both BM and peripheral blood (PB) in children compared with adults (P < 0.001 and P = 0.01). WT1 expression from healthy hematopoiesis was lower in PB compared with BM (WT1BM /WT1PB  = 8.6, 95% CI: 5.3-13.7) and not influenced by infection nor BM regeneration. At AML diagnosis, 66% had more than 20-fold WT1 overexpression in PB or BM (PB 74%; BM 45%). WT1 was quantified in 279 PB samples during follow-up. All 11 patients with PB sampling within 4 months of disease recurrence displayed WT1 overexpression by a median of 1.9 months (range, 0.7-9.7) before hematological relapse. CONCLUSIONS: This study defines child-specific reference values for WT1 expression in healthy hematopoiesis and demonstrates that WT1 expression in PB is a useful post-treatment monitoring tool in childhood AML. Based on these observations, we propose definitions for childhood AML molecular relapse using WT1 overexpression.|Cancer
ID:30900517|Title:Successful role of adjuvant radiotherapy in a rare case of tracheal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor: a case report.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare benign cancer that can express a more aggressive phenotype related to the genetic mutation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase receptor (ALK). Involvement of trachea is extremely rare and due to the clinical and radiologic nonspecificity, the definitive diagnosis is based on the histologic evaluation of tissue specimens. Total surgical excision is curative and chemotherapy or radiotherapy has been employed in the treatment of unresectable tumors or as adjuvant therapies. CASE PRESENTATION: The case described here is being reported because of the rare tracheal location and the atypical treatment approach used for an ALK-positive IMT. A 7-week pregnant woman voluntary interrupted pregnancy and underwent total surgical excision that resulted to have close margins. Although ALK-positive expression indicated the use of ALK inhibitors, she refused any type of adjuvant therapy that could affect ovarian function. Thus, 3D conformational external beam radiotherapy was performed with a daily dose of 180 cGy, 5 times per week, up to 45 Gy at the level of trachea. A total of 62 months of follow-up showed and no signs of disease recurrence or late radiation therapy-related toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: This report describes an extremely rare case of a tracheal IMT, underlying the key role of radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment able to definitively cure IMT, limiting systemic chemotherapy-related toxicity.|Cancer
ID:30902384|Title:[An integral view of cancer (I). The study, classification and reprogramming of the tumoral microclimate].Abstract:The group of diseases that we call cancer share a biological structure formed by a complex ecosystem, with altered intercellular communication, information fields, development and tissue function. Beyond the genetic alterations of the tumor cell, the demonstration of an altered ecosystem, with interconnections at systemic levels, opens up a new perspective on cancer biology and behavior. Different tumor facets, such as morphology, classification, clinical aggressiveness, prognosis and response to treatment now appear under a comprehensive vision that offers a new horizon of study, research and clinical management. The Somatic Mutation Theory in cancer, in force for more than one hundred years, is now completed by the study of the tumor microenvironment, the extracellular matrix, the stromal cells, the immune response, the innervation, the nutrition, the mitochondria, the metabolism, the interstitial fluid, the mechanical and electromagnetic properties of the tissue and many other areas of emerging knowledge; thus opening the door to a reprogramming exercise of the tumor phenotype through the modification of the keys offered by this new paradigm. Its recognition makes it possible to go from considering the oncological process as a cellular problem to a supracellular alteration based on the disorganization of tissues, immersed in the relationships of the complex system of the living being.|Cancer
ID:30904095|Title:The role of inherited genetic variants in colorectal polyposis syndromes.Abstract:Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in women across the world. Most CRCs occur sporadically, but in 15-35% of cases, hereditary factors are important. Some patients with an inherited predisposition to CRC will be diagnosed with a "genetic polyposis syndrome" such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), polymerase proofreading associated polyposis (PPAP), NTHL1-associated polyposis, MSH3-associated polyposis or a hamartomatous polyposis syndrome. Individuals with >=10 colorectal polyps have traditionally been referred for genetic diagnostic testing to identify APC and MUTYH mutations which cause FAP and MAP respectively. Mutations are found in most patients with >100 adenomas but in only a minority of those with 10-100 adenomas. The reasons that diagnostic laboratories are not identifying pathogenic variants include mutations occurring outside of the open reading frames of genes, individuals exhibiting generalized mosaicism and the involvement of additional genes. It is important to identify patients with an inherited polyposis syndrome, and to define the mutations causing their polyposis, so that the individuals and their relatives can be managed appropriately.|Cancer
ID:30904619|Title:Metabolomics of neonatal blood spots reveal distinct phenotypes of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and potential effects of early-life nutrition.Abstract:Early-life exposures are believed to influence the incidence of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Archived neonatal blood spots (NBS), collected within the first days of life, offer a means to investigate small molecules that reflect early-life exposures. Using untargeted metabolomics, we compared abundances of small-molecule features in extracts of NBS punches from 332 children that later developed ALL and 324 healthy controls. Subjects were stratified by early (1-5 y) and late (6-14 y) diagnosis. Mutually-exclusive sets of metabolic features - representing putative lipids and fatty acids - were associated with ALL, including 9 and 19 metabolites in the early- and late-diagnosis groups, respectively. In the late-diagnosis group, a prominent cluster of features with apparent 18:2 fatty-acid chains suggested that newborn exposure to the essential nutrient, linoleic acid, increased ALL risk. Interestingly, abundances of these putative 18:2 lipids were greater in infants who were fed formula rather than breast milk (colostrum) and increased with the mother's pre-pregnancy body mass index. These results suggest possible etiologic roles of newborn nutrition in late-diagnosis ALL.|Cancer
ID:30906574|Title:First-in-human phase 0 study of 111In-CHX-A"-DTPA trastuzumab for HER2 tumor imaging.Abstract:INTRODUCTION: Tumors over-expressing the human epithelial receptor 2 (HER2) or exhibiting amplification or mutation of its proto-oncogene have a poorer prognosis. Using trastuzumab and/or other HER2 targeted therapies can increase overall survival in patients with HER2(+) tumors making it critical to accurately identify patients who may benefit. We report on a Phase 0 study of the imaging agent, 111In-CHX-A"-DTPA trastuzumab, in patients with known HER2 status to evaluate its safety and biodistribution and to obtain preliminary data regarding its ability to provide an accurate, whole-body, non-invasive means to determine HER2 status. METHODS: 111In-CHX-A"-DTPA trastuzumab was radiolabeled on-site and slowly infused into 11 patients who underwent single (n=5) or multiple (n=6) gamma-camera (n=6) and/or SPECT (n=8) imaging sessions. RESULTS: No safety issues were identified. Visual and semi-quantitative imaging data were concordant with tissue HER2 expression profiling in all but 1 patient. The biodistribution showed intense peak liver activity at the initial imaging timepoint (3.3h) and a single-phase clearance fit of the average time-activity curve (TAC) estimated t1/2=46.9h (R2=0.97; 95%CI 41.8 to 53h). This was followed by high gastrointestinal (GI) tract activity peaking by 52h. Linear regression predicted GI clearance by 201.2h (R2 =0.96; 95%CI 188.5 to 216.9h). Blood pool had lower activity with its maximum on the initial images. Non-linear regression fit projected a t1/2=34.2h (R2 =0.96; 95%CI 25.3 to 46.3h). Assuming linear whole-body clearance, linear regression projected complete elimination (x-intercept) at 256.5hr (R2=0.96; 95%CI 186.1 to 489.2h). CONCLUSION: 111In-CHX-A"-DTPA trastuzumab can be safely imaged in humans. The biodistribution allowed for visual and semiquantitative analysis with results concordant with tissue expression profiling in 10 of 11 patients. Advances in Knowledge and Implications for Patient Care Using readily available components and on-site radiolabeling 111In-CHX-A"-DTPA trastuzumab SPECT imaging may provide an economical, non-invasive means to detect HER2 over-expression.|Cancer
ID:30907473|Title:Expandable Immunotherapeutic Nanoplatforms Engineered from Cytomembranes of Hybrid Cells Derived from Cancer and Dendritic Cells.Abstract:Using the cytomembranes (FMs) of hybrid cells acquired from the fusion of cancer and dendritic cells (DCs), this study offers a biologically derived platform for the combination of immunotherapy and traditional oncotherapy approaches. Due to the immunoactivation implicated in the cellular fusion, FMs can effectively express whole cancer antigens and immunological co-stimulatory molecules for robust immunotherapy. FMs share the tumor's self-targeting character with the parent cancer cells. In bilateral tumor-bearing mouse models, the FM-coated nanophotosensitizer causes durable immunoresponse to inhibit the rebound of primary tumors post-nanophotosensitizer-induced photodynamic therapy (PDT). The FM-induced immunotherapy displays ultrahigh antitumor effects even comparable to that of PDT. On the other hand, PDT toward primary tumors enhances the immunotherapy-caused regression of the irradiation-free distant tumors. Consequently, both the primary and the distant tumors are almost completely eliminated. This tumor-specific immunotherapy-based nanoplatform is potentially expandable to multiple tumor types and readily equipped with diverse functions owing to the flexible nanoparticle options.|Cancer
ID:30908656|Title:High-level expression of PRSS3 correlates with metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer.Abstract:BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Serine protease-3 (PRSS3) is a known contributor to the genesis and development of malignant tumors, although its role in gastric cancer (GC) is still unclear. METHODS: PRSS3 expression in GC tissue samples and its relationship with clinicopathological features were analyzed. Effects of GC cellular responses to the introduction of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated interference with tumor PRSS3 expression were also assessed. RESULTS: PRSS3 was significantly upregulated in GC tissues, and PRSS3 protein levels were higher in tumors that developed metastases soon after the surgery compared with those that remained metastasis-free. High expression of PRSS3 was associated with tumor N staging and independently predictive of postoperative prognosis in patients with GC. The V1 variant of PRSS3 was primarily detected in GC tissue and cell lines, the others (V2-V4) being scarcely detectable. Methylation and demethylation drugs had no impact on expression levels of any PRSS3 transcriptional variant. The downregulated PRSS3 expression suppressed GC cell growth, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: PRSS3 appears to act as an oncogene of GC. High PRSS3 expression portends postoperative metastasis, serving as an effective biomarker of poor therapeutic outcomes.|Cancer
ID:30908670|Title:Somatic alterations detected in diagnostic prostate biopsies provide an inadequate representation of multifocal prostate cancer.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The majority of clinical prostate cancers are multifocal with morphological and molecular heterogeneity. Adequate tissue representation is crucial for the clinical utility of multigene panel sequencing of core needle biopsies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genomic heterogeneity in multifocal prostate cancer and to analyze how representative preoperative biopsies are of spatially separated tumor foci. METHODS: We analyzed at least 2 tumor foci and 1 to 3 preoperative biopsy cores from 11 patients. Diagnostic biopsies, as well as fresh frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, from major tumor foci of radical prostatectomy specimens were macrodissected for the enrichment of tumor tissue. DNA was extracted and sequenced. We analyzed structural alterations, mutations, and copy number variations and compared the genomic profiles of tumor foci with those of preoperative biopsies. RESULTS: Alterations were rarely shared between foci, indicating a high degree of genomic heterogeneity. In 8 of 11 men at least 1 tumor focus was represented by the biopsies defined as harboring at least 1 common clonal somatic event. In only one case, somatic alterations from two spatially separate tumors were identified in the biopsies. Of the mutations and structural variants detected in fresh frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostatectomy material, only an average of 19% (range 0-44) and 55% (range 0-100), respectively, were found in preoperative biopsies where a common somatic origin was established. CONCLUSIONS: Multifocal prostate cancer is a somatically heterogeneous disease in which systematic needle biopsies do not provide sufficient molecular representation of the somatic alterations detected in spatially distinct tumor areas. Targeted biopsies, directed at separate tumor foci, could potentially improve tissue representation of these heterogeneous foci in preoperative biopsies.|Cancer
ID:30909992|Title:[Association between the HER2 Gene Status and the Efficacy of First-line Pemetrexed Combined with Platinum Chemotherapy in Patients with Advanced Lung  : Adenocarcinoma].Abstract:BACKGROUND: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is one of the driver genes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several studies have shown that the efficacy of pemetrexed in HER2-mutant NSCLC is controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of pemetrexed combined with platinum chemotherapy in patients with HER2-mutant and HER2 wild-type lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The clinical data of 106 cases of EGFR, ALK, ROS-1, KRAS, BRAF, RET and MET-negative patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients who diagnosed by histopathology in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were retrospectively reviewed. The relationships between HER2 gene status, clinical characteristics and response and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. RESULTS: All of the 106 patients' HER2 status were determined. HER2 mutations occurred in 32 cases (30.2%), no mutations in 74 cases (69.8%). HER2 mutations were common in young, non-smoking and female patients. All patients received first-line pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of patients with HER2-mutant lung adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than those without HER2 mutations (40.6% vs 14.9%, chi2=8.464, P=0.004; 93.8% vs 68.9%, chi2=6.327, P=0.012), and the difference was statistically significant. According to univariate analysis, the PFS was significantly associated with the brain metastases, maintenance chemotherapy and HER2 gene status (P<0.05), but not with age, gender, smoking history, oligometastases, liver metastases and type of platinum (P>0.05). Cox multivariate analysis indicated that HER2 mutation was an independent positive prognostic factor of PFS (P=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: HER2-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients with first-line pemetrexed combined with platinum chemotherapy have greater clinical benefit than HER2 wild-type patients.|Cancer
ID:30910249|Title:Molecular markers in recurrent stage I, grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancers.Abstract:OBJECTIVES: Stage I, grade 1 endometrial cancers have low recurrence rates and often do not receive adjuvant therapy. We compared recurrent cases to matched non-recurrent controls to evaluate for molecular markers associated with higher risk of recurrence. METHODS: A case-control study including all cases of recurrent stage I, grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer at one institution in a ten-year period. Cases were matched to controls by age, BMI, weight and stage. Molecular testing and immunohistochemistry were performed on archival tumor specimens: microsatellite instability (MSI-H), mismatch repair status, POLE mutational status, and next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: 15 stage I, grade 1 endometrial cancer cases with recurrent disease and available tumor specimens were identified. CTNNB1 and MSI-H were present at significantly higher rates in cases than controls (CTNNB1 60% vs. 28%, OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.1-14.7, p = 0.04 and MSI-H 53% vs. 21%, OR 4.4, 95%CI 1.1-17.0, p = 0.03). POLE mutations were found in 0% of cases vs. 7% of controls (p = 0.54). Among specimens demonstrating microsatellite stability (MSS), 100% of cases vs. 26% of controls had CTNNB1 mutations (p < 0.001). CTNNB1 wild type tumors were MSI-H in 100% of cases vs. 19% of controls (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to controls, CTNNB1 mutation is present at significantly higher rates in recurrent stage I, grade 1 endometrial cancers and is found most commonly in MSS tumors. MSI-H is also present at significantly higher rates in recurrent cases. These markers may be useful for prognostic risk stratification and adjuvant therapy decision-making in this otherwise low-risk population.|Cancer
ID:30911841|Title:Comprehensive analysis of the characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with anti-PD-1 therapy in real-world practice.Abstract:PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have shown marked responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in clinical trials. However, because such trials comprise cohorts selected based on specific criteria, it is unclear if their results represent routine clinical practice. METHODS: We examined 155 patients with advanced NSCLC who were administered either nivolumab or pembrolizumab at Yonsei Cancer Center, Korea between March 2014 and January 2019. Patient characteristics, EGFR/ALK mutation status, metastatic locations, response to ICIs, and adverse events were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 64 years and 72.9% of patients were male; former or current smokers constituted 67.1% of the subjects. Adenocarcinoma was predominant (67.7%), and 50.3% of the patients underwent >= 2 previous treatments. Twenty-three patients (14.8%) were EGFR mutation- or ALK rearrangement-positive. The objective response rate (ORR) was 23.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.4-31.4%]; the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.06 (95% CI 1.893-4.21) and 10.25 (95% CI 5.39-15.11) months, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified ECOG performance status, EGFR mutation/ALK rearrangement status, liver metastasis and PD-L1 proportion as independent predictors of OS. Furthermore, 61.9% of the patients had adverse events of any grade; 38.1% had immune-related adverse events that were associated with PFS and OS on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The real-world ORR, PFS, OS, and adverse event profiles were comparable to previous clinical trials despite the patients' different baseline characteristics. Our findings can aid in establishing effective immunotherapeutic management of NSCLC in routine clinical practice.|Cancer
ID:30914778|Title:A combined gene expression tool for parallel histological prediction and gene fusion detection in non-small cell lung cancer.Abstract:Accurate histological classification and identification of fusion genes represent two cornerstones of clinical diagnostics in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we present a NanoString gene expression platform and a novel platform-independent, single sample predictor (SSP) of NSCLC histology for combined, simultaneous, histological classification and fusion gene detection in minimal formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. The SSP was developed in 68 NSCLC tumors of adenocarcinoma (AC), squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) histology, based on NanoString expression of 11 (CHGA, SYP, CD56, SFTPG, NAPSA, TTF-1, TP73L, KRT6A, KRT5, KRT40, KRT16) relevant genes for IHC-based NSCLC histology classification. The SSP was combined with a gene fusion detection module (analyzing ALK, RET, ROS1, MET, NRG1, and NTRK1) into a multicomponent NanoString assay. The histological SSP was validated in six cohorts varying in size (n = 11-199), tissue origin (early or advanced disease), histological composition (including undifferentiated cancer), and gene expression platform. Fusion gene detection revealed five EML4-ALK fusions, four KIF5B-RET fusions, two CD74-NRG1 fusion and three MET exon 14 skipping events among 131 tested cases. The histological SSP was successfully trained and tested in the development cohort (mean AUC = 0.96 in iterated test sets). The SSP proved successful in predicting histology of NSCLC tumors of well-defined subgroups and difficult undifferentiated morphology irrespective of gene expression data platform. Discrepancies between gene expression prediction and histologic diagnosis included cases with mixed histologies, true large cell carcinomas, or poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with mucin expression. In summary, we present a proof-of-concept multicomponent assay for parallel histological classification and multiplexed fusion gene detection in archival tissue, including a novel platform-independent histological SSP classifier. The assay and SSP could serve as a promising complement in the routine evaluation of diagnostic lung cancer biopsies.|Cancer
ID:30917048|Title:Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney.Abstract:Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney is an uncommon malignant pediatric renal neoplasm that typically presents in the 2- to 3-year age group and has a propensity for aggressive behavior and late relapses. Histologically, this tumor exhibits a great diversity of morphologic patterns that can mimic most other pediatric renal neoplasms, often leading to confusion and misdiagnosis. Until recently, adjunct immunohistochemical and molecular genetic tests to support the diagnosis were lacking. The presence of internal tandem duplications in BCL-6 coreceptor (BCOR) and a translocation t(10;17) creating the fusion gene YWHAE-NUTM2B/E have now been well accepted. Immunohistochemistry for BCOR has also been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for clear cell sarcoma of the kidney in the context of pediatric renal tumors. Improved intensive chemotherapy regimens have influenced the clinical course of the disease, with late relapses now being less frequent and the brain having overtaken bone as the most common site of relapse.|Cancer
ID:30918505|Title:Senecavirus A 3C Protease Mediates Host Cell Apoptosis Late in Infection.Abstract:Senecavirus A (SVA), an oncolytic picornavirus used for cancer treatment in humans, has recently emerged as a vesicular disease (VD)-causing agent in swine worldwide. Notably, SVA-induced VD is indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and other high-consequence VDs of pigs. Here we investigated the role of apoptosis on infection and replication of SVA. Given the critical role of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway on modulation of cell death, we first assessed activation of NF-kappaB during SVA infection. Results here show that while early during infection SVA induces activation of NF-kappaB, as evidenced by nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB-p65 and NF-kappaB-mediated transcription, late in infection a cleaved product corresponding to the C-terminus of NF-kappaB-p65 is detected in infected cells, resulting in lower NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. Additionally, we assessed the potential role of SVA 3C protease (3Cpro) in SVA-induced host-cell apoptosis and cleavage of NF-kappaB-p65. Transient expression of SVA 3Cpro was associated with cleavage of NF-kappaB-p65 and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), suggesting its involvement in virus-induced apoptosis. Most importantly, we showed that while cleavage of NF-kappaB-p65 is secondary to caspase activation, the proteolytic activity of SVA 3Cpro is essential for induction of apoptosis. Experiments using the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK confirmed the relevance of late apoptosis for SVA infection, indicating that SVA induces apoptosis, presumably, as a mechanism to facilitate virus release and/or spread from infected cells. Together, these results suggest an important role of apoptosis for SVA infection biology.|Cancer
ID:30919552|Title:Clinical implications of the genetics of sporadic colorectal cancer.Abstract:Colorectal cancer (CRC) is common and at least 80% of cases are sporadic, without any significant family history. Prognostication and treatment have been relatively empirical for what has become increasingly identified as a genetically heterogeneous disease. There are three main genetic pathways in sporadic CRC: the chromosomal instability pathway, the microsatellite instability pathway and the CpG island methylator phenotype pathway. There is significant overlap between these complex molecular pathways and this limits the clinical application of CRC genetics. Recent Australian and New Zealand guidelines recommend routine testing of mismatch repair (MMR) status for new cases of CRC and selective KRAS and BRAF testing on the basis of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications. It is important that all clinicians treating CRC have an understanding of the importance of and basis for identifying key genetic features of CRC. It is likely that in the future better molecular characterization such as that allowed by the consensus molecular subtype classification will allow improved prognostication and targeted therapy in order to deliver more personalized treatment for CRC.|Cancer
ID:30921238|Title:Prognostic values of 18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic parameters and clinical figures in locally advanced pancreatic cancer underwent chemotherapy combined with stereotactic body radiation therapy.Abstract:Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged to be a preference treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic roles of F-FDG PET/CT metabolic parameters and clinical figures in LAPC patients underwent chemo-SBRT combined therapy.During January 2013 to January 2017, 23 LAPC patients who underwent F-FDG PET/CT within 2 weeks before treatment were recruited and retrospectively analyzed. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax), SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), chemoradiotherapy (CRT) sequence, and relevant clinical figures were grouped upon the median values, then analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models for their prognostic evaluation.The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of all patients were 16.7 months and 11.3 months, respectively. According to the statistic results, the longest diameter of tumor (LDT), MTV, TLG, and CRT sequence were associated with OS (all P <.05). Among which, LDT and MTV were proved to be the independent prognostic factors for OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.437, 3.015, both P <.05). Additionally, LDT and CRT sequence were found associated with PFS (both P <.05), and CRT sequence was the independent prognostic factor for PFS in chemo-SBRT treated LAPC patients (HR: 0.130, P <.05).For LAPC patients received chemotherapy and SBRT combined therapy, MTV and LDT showed independent prognostic values for OS. Meanwhile, CRT sequence was an independent PFS prediction factor.|Cancer
ID:30922401|Title:Mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma: clinical pathology and treatment options.Abstract:Mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma is a distinct subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC) characterized by the presence of abundant extracellular mucin which accounts for at least 50% of the tumor volume. Mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma is found in 10%-20% of CRC patients and occurs more commonly in female and younger patients. Moreover, mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma is more frequently located in the proximal colon and diagnosed at an advanced stage. Based on its molecular context, mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma is associated with the overexpression of mucin 2 (MUC2) and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) proteins. At the same time, it shows higher mutation rates in the fundamental genes of the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma also shows higher rates of microsatellite instability (MSI) than non-mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma which might correlate it with Lynch syndrome and the CpG island methylator phenotype. The prognosis of mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma as to non-mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma is debatable. Further, the impaired responses of mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma to palliative or adjuvant chemotherapy warrant more studies to be performed for a specialized treatment for these patients. In this review, we discuss the molecular background and histopathology of mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma, and provide an update on its prognosis and therapeutics from recent literatures.|Cancer
ID:30923916|Title:Genetic variants in RPA1 associated with the response to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is a commonly used first-line chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. Genetic variants in nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway genes may alter genomic integrity and the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. METHODS: We investigated the association between genetic variants in 19 NER pathway genes and the disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS) among 166 colorectal cancer patients who received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis was performed using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal. Gene harboring significant SNP was overexpressed or knocked down to demonstrate the effect on cell phenotypes with or without oxaliplatin treatment. RESULTS: We found that rs5030740, located in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of RPA1, was associated with DCR [OR = 2.99 (1.33-5.69), P = 4.00 x 10-3] and PFS [HR = 1.86 (1.30-2.68), P = 7.39 x 10-4]. The C allele was significantly associated with higher RPA1 mRNA expression levels according to eQTL analysis (P = 0.010 for sigmoid colon and P = 0.004 for transverse colon). The C allele of rs5030740 disrupted let-7e-5p binding to enhance RPA1 expression. Functionally, RPA1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis, whereas RPA1 overexpression promoted proliferation and suppressed apoptosis. Furthermore, low RPA1 expression increased sensitivity to oxaliplatin in colon cancer cells and inhibited proliferation after oxaliplatin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate an association between rs5030740 and the DCR and PFS of colorectal cancer patients. RPA1 functions as a putative oncogene in tumorigenesis by reducing sensitivity to oxaliplatin and could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer.|Cancer
ID:30923996|Title:Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma with t(11;18)(q21;q21) translocation: long-term follow-up results.Abstract:Translocation (11;18)(q21;q21) is found in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, resulting in API2/MALT1 gene fusion. It is known that t(11;18)-positive MALT lymphoma shows a tendency to disseminate and be resistant to Helicobacter pylori eradication by antibiotics. However, the prognostic features including recurrence and histological transformation (HT) remain unknown. We conducted a single-institute retrospective analysis of 464 patients with newly diagnosed MALT lymphoma, evaluating the impact of t(11;18) on clinical outcomes. One hundred and six patients were screened for the translocation by fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Of these patients, 26 patients (25%) were diagnosed as MALT lymphoma with t(11;18). The patients had a significantly shortened progression-free survival (PFS at 10 years; 26% v 57%; P = 0.004) compared to those without t(11;18). However, this did not translate into overall survival or incidence of HT. We confirmed previous reports stating that t(11;18)-positive MALT lymphoma showed disseminated disease and refractoriness to H. pylori eradication therapy. Patients with t(11;18) had more frequent monoclonal gammopathy, especially of IgM subtype (31% v 8%; P = 0.008), some of which developed class switch. These findings characterize the features of t(11;18)-positive MALT lymphoma, suggesting that it comprises a distinct clinical entity of MALT lymphoma.|Cancer
ID:30925542|Title:Comparison of the volumetric and radiomics findings of 18F-FDG PET/CT images with immunohistochemical prognostic factors in local/locally advanced breast cancer.Abstract:OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the change in volumetric and radiomics parameters of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging in local/locally advanced cancer patients according to immunohistochemical findings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 72 patients who were diagnosed with local/locally advanced breast cancer and then examined by F-FDG PET/CT for staging were included in this study. Immunohistochemical prognostic factors [estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2), p53 mutation, Ki-67 proliferation index] and histological grades were determined. Standardized uptake value (SUV)-based, volume-based, and radiomics findings were obtained from F-FDG PET/CT images. RESULTS: In cases of ER and PR negativity, Her-2 positivity, presence of the p53 mutation, and Ki-67 index of at least 20% patients, total volumetric parameters were significantly higher in paired comparisons. The results of the ER-negative group were significantly higher than those of ER-positive patients in GLRLM_GLNU, GLRLM_RLNU, GLZLM_GLNU, and GLZLM_ZLNU comparisons. In grade 3 patients, mean SUV, maximum SUV, and GLRLM_LRHGE values were higher than those of grade 2 patients. SUV and volumetric parameters were significantly higher in patients with Ki-67 index of at least 20% than those with less than 20%. Maximum SUV, breast tumor lesion glycolysis values, and entropy in nuclear polymorphism in the 3+ patient group were found to be higher compared with the 2+ patient group. Moreover, patients with mitosis 3+ had significantly higher breast metabolic tumor volume, breast tumor lesion glycolysis, and kurtosis values than the 1+ group. CONCLUSION: ER negativity, triple negativity, high tumor grade, and high nuclear polymorphism were associated with tumor heterogeneity. With respect to ER negativity, PR negativity, high tumor grade, high mitosis number, high Ki-67 index, Her-2 positivity, and the presence of p53 mutation, an increased tumor load were observed. In addition to immunohistochemical parameters, the use of radiomics data is believed to contribute to breast cancer management.|Cancer
ID:30926971|Title:Genomic subtyping and therapeutic targeting of acute erythroleukemia.Abstract:Acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) is a high-risk leukemia of poorly understood genetic basis, with controversy regarding diagnosis in the spectrum of myelodysplasia and myeloid leukemia. We compared genomic features of 159 childhood and adult AEL cases with non-AEL myeloid disorders and defined five age-related subgroups with distinct transcriptional profiles: adult, TP53 mutated; NPM1 mutated; KMT2A mutated/rearranged; adult, DDX41 mutated; and pediatric, NUP98 rearranged. Genomic features influenced outcome, with NPM1 mutations and HOXB9 overexpression being associated with a favorable prognosis and TP53, FLT3 or RB1 alterations associated with poor survival. Targetable signaling mutations were present in 45% of cases and included recurrent mutations of ALK and NTRK1, the latter of which drives erythroid leukemogenesis sensitive to TRK inhibition. This genomic landscape of AEL provides the framework for accurate diagnosis and risk stratification of this disease, and the rationale for testing targeted therapies in this high-risk leukemia.|Cancer
ID:30927944|Title:Radiogenomics of rectal adenocarcinoma in the era of precision medicine: A pilot study of associations between qualitative and quantitative MRI imaging features and genetic mutations.Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between genetic mutations and qualitative as well as quantitative features on MRI in rectal adenocarcinoma at primary staging. METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients with rectal adenocarcinoma, genome sequencing, and pretreatment rectal MRI were included. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate associations between qualitative features obtained from subjective evaluation of rectal MRI and gene mutations as well as between quantitative textural features and gene mutations. For the qualitative evaluation, Fisher's Exact test was used to analyze categorical associations and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used for continuous clinical variables. For the quantitative evaluation, we performed manual segmentation of T2-weighted images for radiomics-based quantitative image analysis. Thirty-four texture features consisting of first order intensity histogram-based features (n = 4), second order Haralick textures (n = 5), and Gabor-edge based Haralick textures were computed at two different orientations. Consensus clustering was performed with 34 computed texture features using the K-means algorithm with Euclidean distance between the texture features. The clusters resulting from the algorithm were then used to enumerate the prevalence of gene mutations in those clusters. RESULTS: In 65 patients, 45 genes were mutated in more than 3/65 patients (5%) and were included in the statistical analysis. Regarding qualitative imaging features, on univariate analysis, tumor location was significantly associated with APC (p = 0.032) and RASA1 mutation (p = 0.032); CRM status was significantly associated with ATM mutation (p = 0.021); and lymph node metastasis was significantly associated with BRCA2 (p = 0.046) mutation. However, these associations were not significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Regarding quantitative imaging features, Cluster C1 had tumors with higher mean Gabor edge intensity compared with cluster C2 (theta = 0 , p = 0.018; theta = 45 , p = 0.047; theta = 90 , p = 0.037; cluster C3 (theta = 0 , p = 0.18; theta = 45 , p = 0.1; theta = 90 , p = 0.052), and cluster C4 (theta = 0 , p = 0.016; theta = 45 , p = 0.033; theta = 90 , p = 0.014) suggesting that the cluster C1 had tumors with more distinct edges or heterogeneous appearance compared with other clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Although this preliminary study showed promising associations between quantitative features and genetic mutations, it did not show any correlation between qualitative features and genetic mutations. Further studies with larger sample size are warranted to validate our preliminary data.|Cancer
ID:30928887|Title:Ring sideroblasts in chronic phase of polycythemia vera identifies a subset of patients with an increased risk of progression to blast phase.Abstract:Blast phase of PV is often associated with a complex karyotype (CK) and bilineage dysplasia. We hypothesized that BM morphologic abnormalities detected in the Chronic phase (CP) can identify patients with an increased risk of developing blast phase (BP). We also compared cases of BP PV to a group of acute myeloid leukemia cases with JAK2 mutation (AML-JAK2mut). We collected morphological, cytogenetics (CG), and molecular information at the time of diagnosis and at time of diagnosis of BP. We evaluate the presence of splicing factor mutations at BP. A total of 60/477 (12.5%) patients with diagnosis of BP of PV were identified, 17 of them had BM sample available during CP. Ten patients with PV CP were used as control group. We found that dyserythropoiesis during evolution were more frequent in patients who develop BP than in patients who remain in CP (13/17 vs. 3/10; P = .0402). Similarly, ring sideroblast (RS) increase during CP were more frequent in patients who develop BP (8/16 vs. 0/10. P = .0095). By ELN risk stratification for CG risk in BP all patients had adverse or intermediate risk; in AML-JAK2mut 2/11 patients (18%) had favorable as risk category. TP53 mutations were significantly more frequent in BP than in AML-JAK2mut (7/14 vs. 1/11, P = .0421). Mutation analysis for splicing factor at BP was performed on 13 patients. Only 2 patients with >15% RS had SRSF2 (2 patients) and SF3B1 (1 patient) mutations. The other patients were wild type. Dyserythropoiesis and the acquisition of RS precede other markers of disease progression to BP. CK and TP53 mutation are more frequent in BP than in AML-JAK2mut. SF3B1 mutations are rare in BP.|Cancer
ID:30929114|Title:Review of ependymomas: assessment of consensus in pathological diagnosis and correlations with genetic profiles and outcome.Abstract:We focused on histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of ependymoma (EPN) with molecular profiles to develop more reproducible criteria of the diagnosis. Three expert neuropathologists reviewed the pathology of 130 samples from the Japan Pediatric Molecular Neuro-Oncology Group study. Confirmed cases were assessed for histology, surrogate markers, molecular subgrouping, and survival data. We reached a consensus regarding the diagnosis of EPNs in 100% of spinal cord tumors and 93% of posterior fossa (PF) tumors that had been diagnosed as EPNs by local pathologists, whereas we reached a consensus regarding only 77% of the local diagnosis of supratentorial (ST) EPNs. Among the PF-EPNs, most of anaplastic ependymomas (AEPNs) were defined as EPN-A by methylation profiling, which was significantly correlated with the subgroup assignment. Regarding prognosis, the overall survival of patients with PF-EPN was significantly better than that of patients with PF AEPN (p = 0.01). Histologically, all ependymoma, RELA fusion-positive (EPN-RELA) qualified as Grade III. Both L1 cell adhesion molecule and nuclear factor kappaB p65 antibodies showed good sensitivity for detecting EPN-RELA. This study indicated that the expert consensus pathological diagnosis could correlate well with the molecular classifications in EPNs. ST EPNs should be diagnosed more carefully by histological and molecular analyses.|Cancer
ID:30931661|Title:Clear Cell Variant of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma With Associated Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma: Description of an Extraordinary Case.Abstract:Clear cell change is a rare observation in thyroid cancer, resulting from aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of lipids, glycogen, or thyroglobulin in the tumor cells. The phenomenon is most common for follicular thyroid neoplasia, with no definite coupling to patient outcome. The clear cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (ccPTC) is even more infrequent-making conclusions regarding prognosis difficult. Single reports describe distant metastases of ccPTCs as well as co-occurrence with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). In this report, a case of a therapy-resistant ccPTC dedifferentiating into an ATC is characterized from morphological and immunohistochemical standpoints. The patient was a 79-year-old female presenting with a 45-mm nodule in her right thyroid lobe. A first round of cytology raised the suspicion of PTC, but a repeated biopsy verified an ATC diagnosis. Neoadjuvant doxorubicin and external irradiation therapy was administered, and the patient developed lung metastases concomitantly. A palliative lobectomy was performed, and the final diagnosis was a ccPTC with focal dedifferentiation into an ATC. Intriguingly, the ccPTC component was viable and dominated the lesion. The clear cell morphology stemmed from an accumulation of glycogen, while the anaplastic component was devoid of evident clear cell changes. The case is one of exceedingly few descriptions of a ccPTC that dedifferentiates to an ATC, suggesting that this PTC subtype is not without potential for development of a highly lethal tumor component. Moreover, the partial lack of response to neoadjuvant therapy suggests a possible underlying resistance to aggressive treatment modalities in this particular case.|Cancer
ID:30932419|Title:Analysis of LPL gene expression in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Abstract:AIM: The IGHV mutational status is one of the most important markers for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) prognostication. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene expression was found to correlate with IGHV status and was suggested as its surrogate marker. Recent data reported that LPL expression might be influenced by pivotal signalling pathways in CLL. This study aimed to assess LPL gene expression in relation to key immunogenetic and molecular markers of CLL, including IGHV mutational status, B-cell receptor (BCR) stereotypy, TP53, NOTCH1, and SF3B1 gene mutations. Materials and Methods: Expression of LPL mRNA was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 73 CLL patients by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). IGHV, NOTCH1, TP53, and SF3B1 gene mutation analysis was performed by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. RESULTS: 44 of 73 (60%) CLL cases were categorized as LPL-positive based on the cut-off value established by ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis. LPL expression was significantly associated with IGHV mutation status (r = 0.684; p < 0.0001) and tended to correlate with presence of NOTCH1 gene mutations (p = 0.113). BCR stereotyped cases showed higher LPL expression values in comparison to unstereotyped cases in the LPL-positive group of patients (p = 0.041). LPL expression was associated with a shorter overall survival in the entire SLL group (median 107 vs 143, p = 0.048) as well as in Binet A patients, albeit with borderline significance (median 139 vs not reached, p = 0.086). CONCLUSION: LPL expression was found to be closely correlated with IGHV gene mutational status and overall survival, proving LPL as prognostic marker in CLL. Our results also indicate a possible relationship between aberrant expression of LPL and BCR- and NOTCH1-dependent signalling pathways.|Cancer
ID:30933052|Title:Detection of a Circulating MicroRNA Custom Panel in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.Abstract:There is increasing interest in liquid biopsy for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic monitoring, creating the need for reliable and useful biomarkers for clinical practice. Here, we present a protocol to extract, reverse transcribe and evaluate the expression levels of circulating miRNAs from plasma samples of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs of 18-25 nucleotides in length that regulate the expression of target genes at the translational level and play an important role, including that of pro- and anti-angiogenic function, in the physiopathology of various organs. miRNAs are stable in biological fluids such as serum and plasma, which renders them ideal circulating biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment decision-making and monitoring. Circulating miRNA extraction was performed using a rapid and effective method that involves both organic and column-based methodologies. For miRNA retrotranscription, we used a multi-step procedure that considers polyadenylation at 3' and the ligation of an adapter at 5' of the mature miRNAs, followed by random miRNA pre-amplification. We selected a 24-miRNA custom panel to be tested by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and spotted the miRNA probes on array custom plates. We performed qRT-PCR plate runs on a real-time PCR System. Housekeeping miRNAs for normalization were selected using GeNorm software (v. 3.2). Data were analyzed using Expression suite software (v 1.1) and statistical analyses were performed. The method proved to be reliable and technically robust and could be useful to evaluate biomarker levels in liquid samples such as plasma and/or serum.|Cancer

ID:30936351|Title:Ocular infiltration as initial presentation of acute monocytic leukaemia transformed from chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia associated with BRAF V600E mutation.Abstract:Acute monocytic leukaemia (French-British-American classification: AML-M5b) is characterised by a predominance of cells of the monocytic lineage on bone marrow examination. Furthermore, a discerning feature is its tendency for tissue infiltration. While gum hypertrophy and hepatosplenomegaly are common, ocular involvement is rare. Here, we present a case of a 75-year-old man referred with proptosis and monocytosis-subsequently diagnosed as AML-M5b, whose disease course was distinguished by extensive tissue invasion (ocular, pulmonary, liver, spleen). Cytogenetics and molecular tests were consistent with blastic transformation of previously undiagnosed chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, supported by the presence of long-standing, low-grade monocytosis. Notably, a BRAF V600E mutation was also detected-an oncogenic driver previously reported in de novo and therapy-related, but not chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia-transformed, AML-M5b. While an initial response to cytoreductive treatment was observed, his tissue-invasive disease soon progressed with worsening pulmonary infiltrates, disseminated intravascular coagulation and renal failure, resulting in death.|Cancer
ID:30937513|Title:[Bronchoalveolar lavage in hairy cell leukemia with pulmonary infiltration].Abstract:We report a 78-year-old male patient suffering from hairy cell leukemia, presenting clinically mainly with dyspnea. Radiology exhibited bilateral ground-glass shadows. In order to prevent pneumonia as a possible side effect due to conventional chemotherapy, it was decided to first treat the patient with rituximab; however, dyspnea persisted. Therefore, bronchoscopy was performed and specimens were sampled for both histological examination and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis. BAL showed lymphocytosis (28.7%), and by means of immunocytochemistry a few CD79a+ B-lymphocytes as well as lymphoid cells positive for the hairy cell marker DBA44 were observed. In addition, molecular study revealed the BRAF V600E mutation. Thus, the findings of BAL were interpreted as lung infiltration by hairy cell leukemia. This result was confirmed by histology. Following a therapy switch to cladribine, a significant improvement was reached. Pulmonary infiltrates by hairy cell leukemia were rarely described. This case represents the first report of hairy cell leukemia diagnosed by means of BAL. It may be difficult to clearly separate between lymphoma infiltration of the lung and medicamentous pneumonitis, but this differential diagnosis can be supported by morphological methods.|Cancer
ID:30938815|Title:Metachronous Contralateral Male Breast Cancer: Case Report and Literature Review.Abstract:Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare and consequently understudied. Here we present the case of contralateral breast cancer in a male patient nearly a quarter century following his initial breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. The epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, characterization, treatment, and prognosis of male breast cancer are reviewed. MBC accounts for <1% of all breast cancer with an estimated incidence nearly 1.25 per 100,000 person years. Our patient tested positive for ATM mutation of undetermined significance. More commonly in males, a BRCA2 mutation confers a >1 in 15 lifetime risk of breast cancer and is present in >11% of MBC patients, while BRCA1 is present in an estimated <1.5% of MBC patients. The risk of contralateral breast cancer developing in a male with a unilateral lesion is much higher than for a primary male breast cancer in the general population. Men tend to be diagnosed at a later age and stage than females. Prognosis for male and female breast cancer is similar considering both age of patient and stage of the tumor at diagnosis, and similar treatment paradigms have resulted in similar outcomes. Although lumpectomy with radiation therapy may have the same prognosis as mastectomy, the standard of care for male breast cancer continues to be simple mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy.|Cancer
ID:30940785|Title:[A Case of Meningeal Solitary Fibrous Tumour/Haemangiopericytoma WHO Grade III Metastasized to the Spleen Shortly After Tumor Resection].Abstract:Revision of WHO guidelines in 2016 led to the classification of solitary fibrous tumours(SFTs)and haemangiopericytomas(HPCs)as a single tumor entity characterized by NAB2-STAT6 fusion. Standard-of-care treatment involves surgery, but local recurrence and distant metastasis sometimes occur. The average latency to metastasis after surgery is 99 months. A 38-year-old female patient presented with a complaint of headache. An 8x5x2cm lesion showing Gd-T1 enhancement was detected near the superior sagittal sinus. Pathological assessment following resection revealed proliferating, polymorphic, atypical tumor cells with distinct nucleoli in a "patternless pattern." Cellularity was moderate to high, and mitotic figures were observed in 15/10 high power fields. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells tested positive for STAT6, and RT-PCR revealed a NAB2-STAT6 fusion gene(exons 6 and 17, respectively), supporting a diagnosis of SFT/HPC WHO grade III. Despite postoperative radiotherapy, multiple metastases to the spleen were detected 8 months after surgery, and distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed. The pathology of the splenic tumor was similar to that of the intracranial tumor. Recurrent disease in a lymph node was detected 1 month later, and local radiation therapy was administered. The patient died of cancerous peritonitis 5 months later. In this case, exceedingly rapid metastasis to the spleen occurred, despite the administration of vigorous treatment. Here, we review SFT/HPC incidence, treatment, and outcomes to better understand this rare malignancy.|Cancer
ID:30941953|Title:First-line treatment choices of Turkish medical oncologists in metastatic colorectal cancer: A survey study.Abstract:PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the World. RAS-BRAF mutational status and primary tumor location are also important factors for the selection of optimal combinations therapies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the Turkish oncologists' treatment decisions depending on tumor location and mutational status in metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: An online survey link was sent to the medical oncologists who are registered to Turkish Society of Medical Oncology via e-mail and mobile applications. RESULTS: Ninety-four oncologists (85.5%) reported that tumor localization affects their treatment modality. In RAS-BRAF wild type left colon tumors, Turkish oncologists mostly use chemotherapy and anti-EGFR therapy (90.1%) for the first-line treatment, while on the right side, oncologists favored anti-VEGF therapy in combination with chemotherapy (65.5%). BRAF-mutant tumors in left colon had nearly the same rates of treatment tendency with both anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR antibodies in combination with chemotherapy, while in right-sided tumors the main treatment selection of the participants was anti-VEGF-based treatment (83.6%). In RAS-mutant patients, a great number of oncologists selected anti-VEGF-based treatment. On the right and left colon tumors, anti-VEGF treatment options ratios were 91.7 and 92.7%, respectively. Maintenance treatment is usually preferred by oncologists in both anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR-based treatment. CONCLUSION: Turkish oncologists are considering tumor sidedness as an indicator for treatment individualization of patients. The selection of monoclonal antibodies is being affected by tumor localization and mutation status.|Cancer

We assembled carbon nanotube composites on the electrode to enhance electronic conductivity by 6.2-fold and reduce overpotential with a shift of 77 mV. We conjugated hyaluronic acid (HA) to the surface of carbon nanotubes via electrostatic interaction between HA and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA). Consequently, we performed direct electrochemical sensing of CD44 with a dynamic range of 0.01-100 ng/mL and detection limit of 5.94 pg/mL without any postlabeling for amplification, comparable to the best current results. The sensor also displayed high selectivity, reproducibility with relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 5) of 2.57%, and long-term stability for 14 days. We demonstrated applications of the sensor in detection of human serum and cancer cells. Our work guides the development of more sensor types by ligand-protein interactions and contributes to design of interfaces in given biosystems for diagnosis.|Cancer
ID:30943439|Title:The prognostic significance of the long non-coding RNAs "CCAT1, PVT1" in t(8;21) associated Acute Myeloid Leukemia.Abstract:Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) is recently linked to various types of cancers, CCAT and PVT1 are two LncRNAs linked to t(8;21) associated Acute Myeloid Leukemia, the interplay between CCAT, PVT1 and the MYC proto-oncogene implicated in t(8;21) could present an opportunity for using LncRNA as prognostic biomarker or a target for therapy, We investigated the expression levels of LncRNAs in 70 patients; 30 with t(8;21) positive AML and 40 with t(8;21) negative AML, We found that CCAT1 and PVT1 are expressed in higher levels in t(8;21) positive -AML by 5.3 folds compared to t(8;21) negative group; the expression values were significantly associated with high-risk clinical criteria; moreover, they are associated with lower overall survival (OS) rate and leukemia-free survival (LFS), however we didn't find a statistically significant cut-off value of LncRNAs using the Cox regression analysis for Lnc_PVT1 except with LFS, we conclude that high expression levels of CCAT1 and PVT1 are associated with poor prognosis while being poor prognostic biomarkers in t(8;21) associated AML.|Cancer
ID:30943982|Title:Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR promotes exosome secretion by regulating RAB35 and SNAP23 in hepatocellular carcinoma.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence indicates that tumor cells release a large amount of exosomes loaded with cargos during tumorigenesis. Exosome secretion is a multi-step process regulated by certain related molecules. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. However, the role of lncRNA HOTAIR in regulating exosome secretion in HCC cells remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed the relationship between HOTAIR expression and exosome secretion-related genes using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Nanoparticle tracking analysis was performed to validate the effect of HOTAIR on exosome secretion. The transport of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) after overexpression of HOTAIR was detected by transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy analysis of cluster determinant 63 (CD63) with synaptosome associated protein 23 (SNAP23). The mechanism of HOTAIR's regulation of Ras-related protein Rab-35 (RAB35), vesicle associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3), and SNAP23 was assessed using confocal co-localization analysis, phosphorylation assays, and rescue experiments. RESULTS: We found an enrichment of exosome secretion-related genes in the HOTAIR high expression group. HOTAIR promoted the release of exosomes by inducing MVB transport to the plasma membrane. HOTAIR regulated RAB35 expression and localization, which controlled the docking process. Moreover, HOTAIR facilitated the final step of fusion by influencing VAMP3 and SNAP23 colocalization. In addition, we validated that HOTAIR induced the phosphorylation of SNAP23 via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated a novel function of lncRNA HOTAIR in promoting exosome secretion from HCC cells and provided a new understanding of lncRNAs in tumor cell biology.|Cancer
ID:30948335|Title:The role of p53 isoforms' expression and p53 mutation status in renal cell cancer prognosis.Abstract:OBJECTIVES: To analyze p53 mutations and gene expression of p53,  40p53, and  133p53 isoforms in renal cell cancer (RCC) tissues and normal adjacent tissue (NAT) and to associate them to clinical features and outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-one randomly selected patients, with primary, previously untreated RCC, with complete clinicopathohistological data were analyzed. NAT samples were available for 37 cases. Expression of p53,  40p53 and  133p53 was determined using RT-qPCR. A functional yeast-based assay was performed to analyze p53 mutations. RESULTS: More than half (56.1%) of patients harbored functional p53 mutations, and they were significantly younger than those with wild type (WT) p53 (P = 0.032). Expression of p53,  40p53, and  133p53 was upregulated in mutant (MT) p53 RCC compared to WT p53 RCC tissues. However, there was no difference in expression of these isoforms between MT p53 RCC tissues and NAT. Expression of  133p53 was significantly downregulated in WT p53 tissues compared to NAT (P = 0.006). Patients that harbored functional p53 mutation had better overall survival (hazard ratio 4.32, 95% confidence interval 1.46-18.82, P = 0.006). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that tumor stage and p53 mutation might be used as independent prognostic marker for overall survival in RCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the specific events in the carcinogenesis of RCC. p53 isoforms can be differentially expressed depending on p53 mutational status.|Cancer
ID:30952820|Title:The Impact of Brain Metastases and Associated Neurocognitive Aspects on Health Utility Scores in EGFR Mutated and ALK Rearranged NSCLC: A Real World Evidence Analysis.Abstract:BACKGROUND: In lung cancer, brain metastases (BM) and their treatment are associated with high economic burden and inferior health-related quality of life. In the era of targeted therapy, real world evidence through health utility scores (HUS) is critical for economic analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective observational cohort study (2014-2016), outpatients with stage IV lung cancer completed demographic and EQ-5D-3L surveys (to derive HUS). Health states and clinicopathologic variables were obtained from chart abstraction. Patients were categorized by the presence or absence of BM; regression analyses identified factors that were associated with HUS. A subset of patients prospectively completed neurocognitive function (NCF) tests and/or the FACT-brain (FACT-Br) questionnaire, which were then correlated with HUS (Spearman coefficients; regression analyses). RESULTS: Of 519 patients with 1,686 EQ-5D-3L-derived HUS, 94 (18%) completed NCF tests and 107 (21%) completed FACT-Br; 301 (58%) never developed BM, 24 (5%) developed first BM during study period, and 194 (37%) had BM at study entry. The sample was enriched (46%) for EGFR mutations (EGFRm) and ALK-rearrangements (ALKr). There were no HUS differences by BM status overall and in subsets by demographics. In multivariable analyses, superior HUS was associated with having EGFRm/ALKr (p < .0001), no prior radiation for extracranial disease (p < .001), and both intracranial (p = .002) and extracranial disease control (p < .01). HUS correlated with multiple elements of the FACT-Br and tests of NCF. CONCLUSION: Having BM in lung cancer is not associated with inferior HUS in a population enriched for EGFRm and ALKr. Patients exhibiting disease control and those with oncogene-addicted tumors have superior HUS. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In the setting of EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a diagnosis of brain metastases no longer consigns the patient to an inferior health state suggesting that new economic analyses in NSCLC are needed in the era of targeted therapies. Additionally, the EQ-5D questionnaire is associated with measures of health-related quality of life and neurocognitive scores suggesting this tool should be further explored in prospective clinical studies.|Cancer
ID:30953094|Title:The expression of circulating miR-504 in plasma is associated with EGFR mutation status in non-small-cell lung carcinoma patients.Abstract:MicroRNAs (miRNAs), key regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, are grossly misregulated in some human cancers, including non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The aberrant expression of specific miRNAs results in the abnormal regulation of key components of signalling pathways in tumour cells. MiRNA levels and the activity of the gene targets, including oncogenes and tumour suppressors, produce feedback that changes miRNA expression levels and indicates the cell's genetic activity. In this study, we measured the expression of five circulating miRNAs (miR-195, miR-504, miR-122, miR-10b and miR-21) and evaluated their association with EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR (EGFR) mutation status in 66 NSCLC patients. Moreover, we examined the discriminative power of circulating miRNAs for EGFR mutant-positive and -negative NSCLC patients using two different data normalisation approaches. We extracted total RNA from the plasma of 66 non-squamous NSCLC patients (31 of whom had tumours with EGFR mutations) and measured circulating miRNA levels using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The miRNA expression levels were normalised using two endogenous controls: miR-191 and miR-16. We found significant associations between the expression of circulating miR-504 and EGFR-activating mutations in NSCLC patients regardless of the normalisation approach used (p = 0.0072 and 0.0236 for miR-16 and miR-191 normalisation, respectively). The greatest discriminative power of circulating miR-504 was observed in patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions versus wild-type EGFR normalised to miR-191 (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.81, p < 0.0001). Interestingly, circulating miR-504 levels were significantly reduced in the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-mutated subgroup compared to EGFR-mutated patients (p < 0.0030) and those with EGFR/KRAS wild-type tumours (p < 0.0359). Our study demonstrated the feasibility and potential diagnostic value of plasma miR-504 expression analysis to distinguish between EGFR-mutated and wild-type NSCLC patients. However, quality control and normalisation strategies are very important and have a major impact on the outcomes of circulating miRNA analyses.|Cancer
ID:30953289|Title:Noninvasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear Features (NIFTP): Update and Diagnostic Considerations-a Review.Abstract:Advances in our understanding of thyroid lesions, especially those entities with an indolent behavior, has led clinicians to question the most appropriate surgical management of such thyroid nodules. Several studies have shown that the non-invasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas (NI-EFVPC) exhibits poor histopathologic diagnostic reproducibility and have been over-treated as conventional thyroid cancer. In 2015, an international thyroid working group re-evaluated NI-EFVPC and its diagnostic criteria. The new terminology of "noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features" (NIFTP) was accordingly introduced to replace NI-EFVPC. The literature has emphasized that NIFTPs are biologically similar to follicular adenomas lacking lymph node metastases and/or recurrence. While the definition of NIFTP is based on specific morphological parameters, recent studies have questioned whether the criterion allowing less than 1% of true papillae should be revised to a total absence of papillae. The motivation for this revision is the rare finding, in some studies, of lymph nodes with metastatic NIFTP. This review evaluates the existing published series of NIFTP cases, clinical consequences of NIFTP, and emerging changes in the diagnostic criteria for NIFTP. The introduction of NIFTP has resulted in significant impact on the clinical management of thyroid nodules. Recent revisions in the morphological criteria for NIFTP emphasize the need to adhere to very stringent histomorphologic criteria when making a diagnosis of NIFTP. The adoption of NIFTP terminology instead of NI-EFVPC is associated with conservative lobectomy without radioactive iodine treatment in the majority of cases.|Cancer
ID:30953464|Title:Intussusception reveals MUTYH-associated polyposis syndrome and colorectal cancer: a case report.Abstract:BACKGROUND: We are reporting a rare case of MUTYH-associated polyposis, a colorectal cancer hereditary syndrome, diagnosticated after an intussusception. Colorectal cancer is an important cause of cancer related mortality that can be manifested by an intussusception, a rare occurrence in adults and almost always related to tumors. Approximately 5% of colorectal cancers can be attributed to syndromes known to cause hereditary colorectal cancer, such as MUTYH-associated polyposis, autosomal genetic syndrome associated with this disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 44 years old male, that sought medical consultation with a complaint of abdominal discomfort, that after five days changed its characteristics. The patient was sent to the emergency department were a CT-scan revealed intestinal sub-occlusion by ileocolic invagination. Right colectomy was carried out. The anatomic-pathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma and multiples sessile polyps, which led to the suspicion of a genetic syndrome. In the genetics analysis two mutations were observed in the MUTYH gene, and MUTYH-associated polyposis was diagnosticated. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the importance of meticulous analysis of the patient examinations results to identify possible discrete alterations that can lead to improved understanding of disease.|Cancer
ID:30955261|Title:[Diagnosis of lung biopsy employing the 2015 WHO criteria and detection of related oncogenic driver mutations].Abstract:Objective: The diagnostic criteria of lung biopsy specimens by 2015 WHO lung tumor classification were used to evaluate lung biopsy specimens along with detection of genetic alterations of major tumor driving genes including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Methods: The clinical data, histological slides, immunohistochemical stains and special stains of 806 lung biopsy specimens at Beijing Hospital from July 2015 to July 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis of lung cancer was reclassified according to the 2015 WHO lung tumor classification and related gene mutation data were analyzed. Results: During a three-year period, the total number of lung cancer diagnosis was 483 cases, including 221 female and 262 male patients with age ranging from 37 to 85 years (median age of 65 years). There were 40 cases(8.28%) of small cell carcinoma,11 cases (2.28%) of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, 3 cases (0.62%) of combined neuroendocrine carcinoma, 2 cases(0.41%) of atypical carcinoid, 208 cases (43.06%) of adenocarcinoma, 92 cases(19.05%) of non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma, 66 cases (13.66%) of squamous cell carcinoma, 42 cases(8.70%) of non-small cell carcinoma, favor squamous cell carcinoma, 16 cases(3.31%) of non-small cell carcinoma, not otherwise specified, and 3 cases (0.62%) of non-small cell carcinoma, possible adenosquamous carcinoma. Among 202 cases tested, 107 cases (52.97%) showed EGFR mutations, including 86 of 133 cases (64.66%) of adenocarcinoma and 18 of 52 cases (34.62%) of non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma. Twenty two cases were found to have T790M mutation among 27 patients after EGFR TKI targeted drug therapy. Immunohistochemical staining of ALK (D5F3) was positive in 3 of 354 cases of non-small cell lung cancer, confirmed by EML4-ALK fusion gene fluorescence PCR. ROS1 gene fusion was found in 1 of 38 cases. Splicing mutations in exon 14 of MET gene were seen in one case of non-small cell carcinoma with spindle cell differentiation. Conclusion: The new diagnostic criteria by the 2015 WHO lung tumor classification is better suited for diagnosing lung biopsy specimens and providing accurate treatment guidance and improving the patient outcome.|Cancer
ID:30955263|Title:[Dedifferentiated liposarcoma with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor-like features: a clinicopathological analysis of five cases].Abstract:Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological features, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT)-like features. Methods: Five cases of DDLPS with IMT-like features were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the First People's Hospital of Qinzhou between 2013 and 2018. EnVision method and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to detect the immunophenotype of the tumor cells and the profile of MDM2 gene amplification respectively. Results: All five cases were male and the median age was 61 (range 53 to 65) years. The clinical symptoms were mainly related to the space-occupying lesions. The tumors were located in duodenal mesentery (two cases), intestinal wall (one case), retroperitoneum (one case), and spermatic cord (one case). Grossly, the tumors were not well encapsulated, ranging from 3 to 13 cm (median 6.7 cm) in diameter, with tan to gray and firm cut surface. Histologically, the dedifferentiated component closely resembled inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), with spindle/polygonal/stellate-shaped cells arranged in storiform, sheet-like, or random pattern, with varying degrees of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. All three major patterns seen in IMT (myxoid, cellular and hypocellular fibrous) were observed, the hypocellular fibrous pattern was the most common. Well-differentiated liposarcomatous component was found in the peripheral areas of all the tumors. One case had high grade dedifferentiated component. Four cases were strongly positive for MDM2 and p16. Two cases were positive for SMA, and one case was focally positive for desmin and one for CD34. None of the cases stained for ALK-1. FISH demonstrated MDM2 gene amplification in all five cases. Clinical follow-ups were available in all five cases and the interval ranged from 3 to 66 months (median 23 months). Two patients developed recurrences and one patient had metastasis. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of tumor recurrence at 3 and 14 months after surgery respectively. Conclusions: DDLPS with IMT-like features is a more aggressive neoplasm than its histological mimic (IMT), and should not be misdiagnosed as other intermediate or low-grade malignant tumors, such as IMT, sclerosing liposarcoma, inflammatory liposarcoma, aggressive fibromatosis, solitary fibrous tumors, low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma, and low-grade fibrosarcoma.|Cancer
ID:30955977|Title:Pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for previously untreated, PD-L1-expressing, locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (KEYNOTE-042): a randomised, open-label, controlled, phase 3 trial.Abstract:BACKGROUND: First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy improves overall and progression-free survival in patients with untreated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumour proportion score (TPS) of 50% or greater. We investigated overall survival after treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done in 213 medical centres in 32 countries. Eligible patients were adults (>=18 years) with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without a sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1, life expectancy 3 months or longer, and a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. Randomisation was computer generated, accessed via an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system, and stratified by region of enrolment (east Asia vs rest of world), ECOG performance status score (0 vs 1), histology (squamous vs non-squamous), and PD-L1 TPS (>=50% vs 1-49%). Enrolled patients were randomly assigned 1:1 in blocks of four per stratum to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles or the investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy for four to six cycles. Primary endpoints were overall survival in patients with a TPS of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater (one-sided significance thresholds, p=0 0122, p=0 0120, and p=0 0124, respectively) in the intention-to-treat population, assessed sequentially if the previous findings were significant. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02220894. FINDINGS: From Dec 19, 2014, to March 6, 2017, 1274 patients (902 men, 372 women, median age 63 years [IQR 57-69]) with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater were allocated to pembrolizumab (n=637) or chemotherapy (n=637) and included in the intention-to-treat population. 599 (47%) had a TPS of 50% or greater and 818 patients (64%) had a TPS of 20% or greater. As of Feb 26, 2018, median follow-up was 12 8 months. Overall survival was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group in all three TPS populations (>=50% hazard ratio 0 69, 95% CI 0 56-0 85, p=0 0003; >=20% 0 77, 0 64-0 92, p=0 0020, and >=1% 0 81, 0 71-0 93, p=0 0018). The median surival values by TPS population were 20 0 months (95% CI 15 4-24 9) for pembrolizumab versus 12 2 months (10 4-14 2) for chemotherapy, 17 7 months (15 3-22 1) versus 13 0 months (11 6-15 3), and 16 7 months (13 9-19 7) versus 12 1 months (11 3-13 3), respectively. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 113 (18%) of 636 treated patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 252 (41%) of 615 in the chemotherapy group and led to death in 13 (2%) and 14 (2%) patients, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The benefit-to-risk profile suggests that pembrolizumab monotherapy can be extended as first-line therapy to patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without sensitising EGFR or ALK alterations and with low PD-L1 TPS.

ID:30956778|Title:Specific allelic variants of SNPs in the MDM2 and MDMX genes are associated with earlier tumor onset and progression in Caucasian breast cancer patients.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Genetic factors play a substantial role in breast cancer etiology. Genes encoding proteins that have key functions in the DNA damage response, such as p53 and its inhibitors MDM2 and MDMX, are most likely candidates to harbor allelic variants that influence breast cancer susceptibility. The aim of our study was to comprehensively analyze the impact of SNPs in the TP53, MDM2, and MDMX genes in conjunction with TP53 mutational status regarding the onset and progression of breast cancer. METHODS: In specimen from 815 breast cancer patients, five SNPs within the selected genes were analyzed: TP53 - Arg72Pro (rs1042522), MDM2 - SNP285 (rs2279744), SNP309 (rs117039649); MDMX - SNP31826 (rs1563828), and SNP34091 (rs4245739). Classification of the tumors was evaluated by histomorphology. Subtyping according hormone receptor status, HER2-status and proliferation rate enabled provision of the clinico-pathological surrogate of intrinsic subtypes. RESULTS: The homozygous C-allele of MDM2 SNP285 was significantly associated with a younger age-at-diagnosis of 44.2 years, in contrast to G/G- and G/C-patients (62.4, 62.7 yrs., respectively; p = 0.0007; log-Rank-test). In contrast, there was no difference regarding the age-at-diagnosis for patients with the respective genotypes of MDM2 SNP309 (p = 0.799; log-Rank-test). In patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and TP53-mutated tumors, however, the T/T-genotype of the MDM2 SNP309 was significantly associated with an earlier average age-at-diagnosis compared with T/G+G/G-patients (53.5 vs. 68.2 yrs; p = 0.002; log-Rank-test). In the triple-negative subgroup, the G/G-patients had an average age-at-diagnosis of 51 years compared with 63 years for SNP309T carriers (p = 0.004; log-Rank-test) indicating a susceptibility of the G/G genotype for the development of triple negative breast cancer. Patients with the A/A-genotype of MDMX SNP31826 with ER-negative tumors were diagnosed 11 years earlier compared with patients and ER-positive tumors (53.2 vs. 64.4 yrs; p = 0.025, log-Rank-test). Furthermore, in luminal B-like patients (HER2-independent) the C/C-genotype of MDMX SNP34091 was significantly correlated with a decreased event-free survival compared with the A/A-genotype (p < 0.001; log-Rank-test). CONCLUSIONS: We showed that SNPs in the MDM2 and MDMX genes affect at least in part the onset and progression of breast cancer dependent on the ER-status. Our findings provide further evidence for the distinct etiological pathways in ER-negative and ER-positive breast cancers.|Cancer
ID:30957187|Title:miR-27b-3p and miR-607 cooperatively regulate BLM gene expression by directly targeting the 3'-UTR in PC3 cells.Abstract:BLM RecQ like helicase (BLM) has a pivotal role in genetic recombination, transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair, which presents the possibility of using BLM as an anti-cancer target for treatment. However, the post-transcriptional control regulation of BLM gene expression is not fully understood and limits the application of drugs targeting BLM for carcinoma therapy in the future. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) inhibit gene expression through interaction with the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of mRNA at the post-transcriptional stage. Therefore, the current study screened for miRNAs that regulate BLM gene expression, with software predicting that miRNA (miR)-27b-3p, miR-607, miR-361-3p, miR-628-5p and miR-338-3p. BLM gene expression levels in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line and RWPE-2 normal prostate epithelium cell line were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Additionally, BLM mRNA levels were following miRNA overexpression for 24 and 48 h. For further miRNA filtration and validation, a dual-luciferase reporter system and western blot analysis were performed, which demonstrated that miR-27b-3p and miR-607 reduce BLM gene expression by directly targeting the BLM mRNA 3'-UTR. A Box-Behnken design experiment suggested that miR-27b-3p and miR-607 have synergetic mutual effects on BLM gene expression. Finally, the suppressive effect of miR-27b-3p and miR-607 on PC3 cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion indicated the benefit of studying BLM as a drug target in cancer. In conclusion, the findings of the current provide evidence that miR-27b-3p and miR-607 have an oncosuppressive function in PC3 cells and cooperatively downregulate BLM expression at the post-transcriptional level.|Cancer
ID:30961661|Title:GTSE1 is involved in breast cancer progression in p53 mutation-dependent manner.Abstract:BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of the high throughput detection techniques, tumor-related Omics data has become an important source for studying the mechanism of tumor progression including breast cancer, one of the major malignancies worldwide. A previous study has shown that the G2 and S phase-expressed-1 (GTSE1) can act as an oncogene in several human cancers. However, its functional roles in breast cancer remain elusive. METHOD: In this study, we analyzed breast cancer data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases and other online database including the Oncomine, bc-GenExMiner and PROGgeneV2 database to identify the molecules contributing to the progression of breast cancer. The GTSE1 expression levels were investigated using qRT-PCR, immunoblotting and IHC. The biological function of GTSE1 in the growth, migration and invasion of breast cancer was examined in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 cell lines. The in vitro cell proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities were evaluated by MTS, colony formation and transwell assay, respectively. The role of GTSE1 in the growth and metastasis of breast cancer were revealed by in vivo investigation using BALB/c nude mice. RESULTS: We showed that the expression level of GTSE1 was upregulated in breast cancer specimens and cell lines, especially in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and p53 mutated breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, high GTSE1 expression was positively correlated with histological grade and poor survival. We demonstrated that GTSE1 could promote breast cancer cell growth by activating the AKT pathway and enhance metastasis by regulating the Epithelial-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Furthermore, it could cause multidrug resistance in breast cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that GTSE1 could regulate the p53 function to alter the cell cycle distribution dependent on the mutation state of p53. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that GTSE1 played a key role in the progression of breast cancer, indicating that GTSE1 could serve as a novel biomarker to aid in the assessment of the prognosis of breast cancer.|Cancer
ID:30962859|Title:Increased breast cancer risk in women with neurofibromatosis type 1: a meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a cancer predisposing syndrome. Studies suggest that women < 50 years old (y.o.) with NF1 have an increased breast cancer (BC) incidence and BC associated mortality. However, this has not been widely recognized secondary to small study populations. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted through database searches for BC and NF1: 3456 articles identified, 166 reviewed, 58 used for descriptive analysis and 4 utilized for meta-analysis. Fisher's exact tests, Kaplan-Meier curves and random-effects meta-analysis models were used for analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-six cases of NF1 and female BC were identified with a median age of 46 years at diagnosis; 53% were <  50. Peak age of BC diagnosis was between 34 to 44 years. Women < 50 y.o. presented with more advanced disease vs. those >=50 (56% vs. 22% stage III-IV, respectively; p = 0.005). Median survival for the entire cohort was 5 years vs. the reported median BC survival of over 20 years in the general population using the SEER database. Median age at BC death was 48.5 years; 64% of deceased patients were <  50. Meta-analysis of a total of 4178 women with NF1 revealed a BC standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 3.07 (95%CI 2.16-4.38) for women with NF1 vs. the general population. Women < 50 y.o. demonstrated a higher SIR of 5.08 (95%CI 3.77-6.81) compared to 1.92 (95%CI 1.40-2.63) if >=50 y.o. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic literature review and meta-analysis suggests that women with NF1 <  50 y.o. have a five-fold increased risk of BC, present with more advanced disease, and may have an increased BC related mortality. Increased awareness and implementation of recent National Comprehensive Cancer Network early BC screening guidelines for this high-risk patient population is essential. Additional evaluation on the influence of NF1 gene mutations identified in patients undergoing hereditary cancer genetic testing on breast cancer risk in individuals without clinical evidence of NF1 is needed.|Cancer
ID:30963251|Title:An update on the central nervous system manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1.Abstract:Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that presents with variable phenotypes as a result of mutations in the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene and subsequently, abnormal function of the protein product, neurofibromin. Patients with NF1 are at increased risk for central nervous system (CNS) manifestations including structural, functional, and neoplastic disease. The mechanisms underlying the varied manifestations of NF1 are incompletely understood, but the loss of functional neurofibromin, resulting in sustained activation of the oncoprotein RAS, is responsible for tumorigenesis throughout the body, including the CNS. Much of our understanding of NF1-related CNS manifestations is from a combination of data from animal models and natural history studies of people with NF1 and CNS disease. Data from animal models suggest the importance of both Nf1 mutations and somatic genetic alterations, such as Tp53 loss, for development of neoplasms, as well as the role of the timing of the acquisition of such alterations on the variability of CNS manifestations. A variety of non-neoplastic structural (macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, aqueductal stenosis, and vasculopathy) and functional (epilepsy, impaired cognition, attention deficits, and autism spectrum disorder) abnormalities occur with variable frequency in individuals with NF1. In addition, there is increasing evidence that similar appearing CNS neoplasms in people with and without the NF1 syndrome are due to distinct oncogenic pathways. Gliomas in people with NF1 show alterations in the RAS/MAPK pathway, generally in the absence of BRAF alterations (common to sporadic pilocytic astrocytomas) or IDH or histone H3 mutations (common to diffuse gliomas subsets). A subset of low-grade astrocytomas in these patients remain difficult to classify using standard criteria, and occasionally demonstrate morphologic features resembling subependymal giant cell astrocytomas that afflict patients with tuberous sclerosis complex ("SEGA-like astrocytomas"). There is also emerging evidence that NF1-associated high-grade astrocytomas have frequent co-existing alterations such as ATRX mutations and an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) phenotype responsible for unique biologic properties. Ongoing efforts are seeking to improve diagnostic accuracy for CNS neoplasms in the setting of NF1 versus sporadic tumors. In addition, MEK inhibitors, which act on the RAS/MAPK pathway, continue to be studied as rational targets for the treatment of NF1-associated tumors, including CNS tumors.|Cancer
ID:30963570|Title:Non-V600E BRAF mutations and EGFR signaling pathway in colorectal cancer.Abstract:The Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAFV600E ) mutation (MT) in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is a well-known prognostic indicator and a negative predictive biomarker for antiepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) treatment. However, the clinical characteristics and significance of BRAFnon-V600E MTs remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the clinical characteristics of BRAFnon-V600E MTs vs. those of other MTs in the EGFR signaling pathway, including BRAFV600E . Consecutive CRC patients in our institute from June 2012 to November 2013 were enrolled in our study. Multiplex genotyping of the EGFR pathway was performed with archival samples using a Luminex Assay for BRAFV600E /BRAFnon-V600E , KRAS/NRAS exons 2-4, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA). We analyzed correlations among the MT profiles, clinical data and primary tumor locations in CRC. All statistical analyses were performed using R software. CRC samples (824) from 374 (45.4%) male and 450 (54.6%) female patients were analyzed, of which 154 (18.7%), 202 (24.5%), 270 (32.8%) or 198 (24.0%) had Stages I, II, III or IV or recurrent CRC, respectively. The frequencies of BRAFV600E /BRAFnon-V600E , KRAS (including exons 2-4), NRAS and PIK3CA MTs were 5.3/1.7, 41.4, 3.3 and 9.6%, respectively. The characteristics of patients with the BRAFV600E MT were an age of >=65 years old, a right-sided primary tumor location, poorly differentiated histology and an advanced disease stage. In contrast, the characteristics of patients with BRAFnon-V600E MTs were a left-sided primary tumor location and well-differentiated histology. BRAFnon-V600E MTs were relatively rare and showed different characteristics compared to the BRAFV600E MT. These results may contribute to future precision medicine.|Cancer
ID:30964475|Title:Endosomal escape by photo-activated fusion of liposomes containing a malachite green derivative: a novel class of photoresponsive liposomes for drug delivery vehicles.Abstract:We conducted photo-activated delivery of drugs based on the fusion of liposomes with endocytic membranes, thus allowing the direct release of encapsulated drugs inside the cytoplasm. As described in our earlier works, liposomes can be photoresponsive and fusogenic following the incorporation of a malachite green derivative carrying a long alkyl chain (MGL) into the lipid membrane. We prepared MGL liposomes using 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine and encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX). Though the shape of MGL liposomes became elliptical after encapsulating DOX, UV irradiation did not enhance DOX leakage from MGL liposomes. We demonstrated the cellular uptake of MGL liposomes into murine cells derived from colon cancer (Colon 26 cells) using flow cytometry, and we found that the uptake was governed by a clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway. Confocal fluorescence microscopic observations of Colon 26 cells treated with MGL liposomes encapsulating DOX revealed that DOX was localized in endosomes under dark conditions, while DOX was observed in the cytosol and nucleus after UV irradiation. The viability of Colon 26 cells treated with MGL liposomes encapsulating DOX was reduced by UV irradiation, indicating photo-induced enhancement of anti-cancer efficacy.|Cancer
ID:30967556|Title:Defective homologous recombination DNA repair as therapeutic target in advanced chordoma.Abstract:Chordomas are rare bone tumors with few therapeutic options. Here we show, using whole-exome and genome sequencing within a precision oncology program, that advanced chordomas (n = 11) may be characterized by genomic patterns indicative of defective homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair and alterations affecting HR-related genes, including, for example, deletions and pathogenic germline variants of BRCA2, NBN, and CHEK2. A mutational signature associated with HR deficiency was significantly enriched in 72.7% of samples and co-occurred with genomic instability. The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib, which is preferentially toxic to HR-incompetent cells, led to prolonged clinical benefit in a patient with refractory chordoma, and whole-genome analysis at progression revealed a PARP1 p.T910A mutation predicted to disrupt the autoinhibitory PARP1 helical domain. These findings uncover a therapeutic opportunity in chordoma that warrants further exploration, and provide insight into the mechanisms underlying PARP inhibitor resistance.|Cancer
ID:30968154|Title:Diverse and cancer type-specific roles of the p53 R248Q gain-of-function mutation in cancer migration and invasiveness.Abstract:Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the TP53 gene lead to acquisition of new functions by the mutated tumor suppressor p53 protein. A number of the over-represented 'hot spot' mutations, including the ones in codons 175, 248 or 273, convey GOF phenotypes. Such phenotypes may include resistance to chemotherapeutics or changes in motility and invasiveness. Whereas the prevalent notion is that the acquisition of the p53 GOF phenotype translates into poorer prognosis for the patient, the analysis of a human somatic p53 mutations dataset demonstrated earlier tumor onset, but decreased frequency and altered location of metastases in patients with the p53-R248Q allele. Therefore, the GOF activities of p53-R248Q and p53-D281G were analyzed in triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cell lines with regard to invasive and metastatic traits. The expression of p53-D281G increased the motility and invasiveness of the lung cancer cells, but not those of the breast cancer cells. In contrast, the expression of p53-R248Q decreased the motility and invasiveness of the breast and lung cancer cells in a p53 transactivation-dependent manner. The intravenous xenotransplantation of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing p53-R248Q into zebrafish embryos resulted in an alteration of the distribution of cancer cells in the body of the fish. In p53-R248Q-expressing H1299 cells a decrease in the expression of TCF8/ZEB1 and N-cadherin was observed, suggesting partial mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. In the two cell lines expressing p53-R248Q a decrease was noted in the expression of myosin light chain 2, a protein involved in actomyosin-based motility. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is one of only few reports demonstrating the mutated p53 GOF activity resulting in a decrease of a malignant trait in human cancer.|Cancer
ID:30970592|Title:Different Clinical Presentations and Management in Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS).Abstract:Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder resulting from maternally inherited or de novo mutations involving the androgen receptor gene, situated in the Xq11-q12 region. The diagnosis is based on the presence of female external genitalia in a 46, XY human individual, with normally developed but undescended testes and complete unresponsiveness of target tissues to androgens. Subsequently, pelvic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could be helpful in confirming the absence of Mullerian structures, revealing the presence of a blind-ending vagina and identifying testes. CAIS management still represents a unique challenge throughout childhood and adolescence, particularly regarding timing of gonadectomy, type of hormonal therapy, and psychological concerns. Indeed this condition is associated with an increased risk of testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT), although TGCT results less frequently than in other disorders of sex development (DSD). Furthermore, the majority of detected tumoral lesions are non-invasive and with a low probability of progression into aggressive forms. Therefore, histological, epidemiological, and prognostic features of testicular cancer in CAIS allow postponing of the gonadectomy until after pubertal age in order to guarantee the initial spontaneous pubertal development and avoid the necessity of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) induction. However, HRT is necessary after gonadectomy in order to prevent symptoms of hypoestrogenism and to maintain secondary sexual features. This article presents differential clinical presentations and management in patients with CAIS to emphasize the continued importance of standardizing the clinical and surgical approach to this disorder.|Cancer
ID:30971355|Title:Prevalence and prognostic value of c-kit and TP53 mutations in canine mast cell tumours.Abstract:Cutaneous mast cell tumours (MCT) are among the most frequent malignancies in dogs. Their clinical behaviour is highly variable and, with the exception of mutations in the c-kit gene, little is known about their genetic aetiology. The mutational status of the c-kit exons 8, 9 and 11, and exons 5-8 of the TP53 gene was analysed to find markers for molecular stratification of MCTs and predictors of clinical outcome. Mutations in the c-kit gene were detected in 19.5% (n = 8/41) samples and their presence was significantly associated with the high histopathological grade (P = 0.038). Mutations in the DNA binding domain of the TP53 gene were found in 14.6% (n = 6/41) of the analysed MCTs, and their frequency was similar in low and high grade MCTs (P > 0.05). TP53 mutations were not useful prognostic factors in this sample of canine cutaneous MCTs.|Cancer
ID:30971541|Title:The diagnostic significance of trophoblast cell-surface antigen-2 expression in benign and malignant thyroid lesions.Abstract:CONTEXT: Thyroid cancers are the most common malignancy of the endocrine system. Over-expression of trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP-2) in various tumors has been found to correlate with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluateTROP-2 expression in thyroid neoplasms. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study contained 152 cases, including 48 follicular nodular disease (FND), 29 follicular adenoma (FA), 57 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 12 follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), 3 medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 2 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) and 1 undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UDTC). TROP-2 expression was investigated via immunohistochemistry in sections prepared from paraffin blocks of the cases. RESULTS: The cases comprised 32 (21%) males and 120 (79%) females with a mean age of 46.8 years (range, 15-85 years). TROP-2 expression was observed in 74.6% of the malignant lesions of the thyroid except for medullary carcinoma, poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma. Immunoreactivity was 3.4% in FA, 41.7% of cases with FTC and 81.8% in PTC follicular variant (PTC fv). The difference between FA/FTC and FA/PTC follicular variant were both significant (P < 0.005, P < 0.001, respectively). There was no difference between FTC/PTC fv (P = 0.089). CONCLUSION: TROP-2 can be considered a useful marker for distinguishing PTC fv cases from follicular nodular disease and follicular adenoma cases because of its high sensitivity in the identification of papillary carcinomas of the thyroid.|Cancer
ID:30971562|Title:Posttransplant epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma: A case report.Abstract:Epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma (EIMS) is a rare entity and a novel variant of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), usually seen in children and nonsmoking young adults. Their occurrence in a posttransplant setting is still rare. These tumors are characterized by prominent epithelioid morphology, large histiocytoid "Reed Sternberg"-like cell, unique pattern of ALK immuno-reactivity, and aggressive clinical behavior. Their etiology and metastatic potential is controversial. In a post-transplant setting, many factors such as trauma, infections with EBV, HIV, Hepatitis C, mycobacteria, fungus, and chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression have been implicated in their etiology. We present the case of a 2-year-old female child who developed multiple omental and mesenteric tumor nodules, 8 months post liver transplant for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). Following a histopathological diagnosis of "mesenchymal neoplasm of possible malignant nature" on a trucut biopsy and frozen section, tumor debulking was performed. A final histological diagnosis of EMIS was made on the completely resected tumor. The patient remains in remission nearly 7 months after presentation, without any follow-up systemic chemotherapy. IMT after a solid organ transplant is rare, only 5 cases have been reported in the literature until now. Similar phenomenon has also been noted with hematopoietic stem cell transplant. However, to our knowledge, this case of EMIS in a post liver transplant patient is first of its kind.|Cancer
ID:30971563|Title:Epithelioid sarcoma of paratesticular region: A case report of an unusual case.Abstract:Primary tumors of the paratesticular region are rare, with sarcomas constituting a major proportion, particularly in the old age. The paratesticular region consists of mesothelial, various epithelial, and mesenchymal cells and may therefore give rise to a variety of tumors. Epithelioid sarcoma usually occurs at the distal extremities of young adults. The proximal-type variant is characterized by a more aggressive course and resistance to treatment. We herein report a case of 32 years male with scrotal swelling diagnosed as proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma of paratesticular region after histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second case of proximal epithelioid sarcoma of paratesticular region in the English literature. As these tumors are rare, it has been difficult to establish their optimal treatment. Also, these can be easily misdiagnosed as other epithelioid lesions.|Cancer
ID:30973434|Title:The Effect of Inhaler Aromatherapy on Invasive Pain, Procedure Adherence, Vital Signs, and Saturation During Port Catheterization in Oncology Patients.Abstract:The study was conducted to evaluate the effect of inhaler aromatherapy on invasive pain, procedure adherence, vital signs, and saturation during port catheter insertion among patients diagnosed with cancer. The study was conducted in a nonrandomized controlled trial. Sixty patients including 30 patients in the intervention group and 30 patients in the control group, who were subjected with the same local anesthetic protocol, were included in the study. Aromatic mixture prepared by diluting orange, chamomile, and lavender oil in 70 mL distilled water was inhaled by the intervention group during the procedure. The data of the study were collected by using questionnaire, vital follow-up form, and visual analog scale. The patients in the intervention and control groups were similar in terms of sociodemographic and disease characteristics (P > .05). It was determined that inhaler aromatherapy applied to patients in the intervention group decreased pain experienced during the procedure and facilitated the procedure adherence (P < .05); however, it did not affect vital signs and saturation (P > .05). It can be recommended to administer inhaler aromatherapy with pharmacological therapies during catheterization procedure since it decreases invasive pain and facilitates the procedure adherence.|Cancer
ID:30974190|Title:Clinical spectrum of Li-Fraumeni syndrome/Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome in Brazilian individuals with the TP53 p.R337H mutation.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The TP53 p.R337H germline mutation is highly prevalent among children with adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) from South and Southeast Brazil. However, the prevalence of other tumors of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL) spectrum, the clinical outcomes and the potential tumor occurrence in relatives carrying this distinct TP53 mutation were not fully investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated tumor profile data and outcomes of individuals and their close relatives with the TP53 p.R337H germline mutation. A questionnaire and the Toronto protocol were used for evaluation of asymptomatic carriers of this TP53 mutation. RESULTS: The cohort of this study comprised 51 patients from 46 different families; 67% were female. All but one harbored the TP53 p.R337H mutation in heterozygous state; only one child was homozygous for this variant. Maternal allele inheritance occurred in 72% of the cases (p= 0,002). In pediatric group, ACT was the most common primary tumor at the diagnosis (55%; median age= 2 years). No patient of the pediatric group who initially presented with ACT developed a second primary tumor and 11% (n= 3) died due to complications related to the primary tumor (median follow-up time of 81.5 months, range= 3-378 months). In adult group, the main tumors at diagnosis were: adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) (23%; median age= 29.5 years), breast cancer (12%; median age= 38.5 years), soft tissue sarcoma (8%; median age= 50.3 years) and choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) (2%; median age= 18 years). Among adult patients who were diagnosed with ACC as the first primary tumor, all presented with aggressive disease as per histologic and clinical criteria at diagnosis, and 75% of patients died (median follow-up time of 19 months, range= 1-69 months). Five adult patients (22%) had a second primary tumor, including bronchoalveolar lung cancer (2 cases), ACC, uterine cervical carcinoma and fibrosarcoma. The diagnosis of these tumors was established from 8 to 36 months after the first primary tumor. Three families presented more than one case of ACT. Nine malignant neoplasms were diagnosed in asymptomatic carriers using Toronto protocol. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a high frequency of TP53 p.R337H mutation in pediatric group with ACT. In addition, we observed the occurrence of other tumors of LFS/LFL spectrum and a difference in the aggressiveness of ACTs depending on the age group in which they were diagnosed. The predominance of maternal mutated allele inheritance was first demonstrated in the affected Brazilian's families.|Cancer
ID:30975761|Title:Inherited predisposition to malignant mesothelioma and overall survival following platinum chemotherapy.Abstract:Survival from malignant mesothelioma, particularly pleural mesothelioma, is very poor. For patients with breast, ovarian, or prostate cancers, overall survival is associated with increased sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy due to loss-of-function mutations in DNA repair genes. The goal of this project was to evaluate, in patients with malignant mesothelioma, the relationship between inherited loss-of-function mutations in DNA repair and other tumor suppressor genes and overall survival following platinum chemotherapy. Patients with histologically confirmed malignant mesothelioma were evaluated for inherited mutations in tumor suppressor genes. Survival was evaluated with respect to genotype and site of mesothelioma. Among 385 patients treated with platinum chemotherapy, median overall survival was significantly longer for patients with loss-of-function mutations in any of the targeted genes compared with patients with no such mutation (P = 0.0006). The effect of genotype was highly significant for patients with pleural mesothelioma (median survival 7.9 y versus 2.4 y, P = 0.0012), but not for patients with peritoneal mesothelioma (median survival 8.2 y versus 5.4 y, P = 0.47). Effect of patient genotype on overall survival, measured at 3 y, remained independently significant after adjusting for gender and age at diagnosis, two other known prognostic factors. Patients with pleural mesothelioma with inherited mutations in DNA repair and other tumor suppressor genes appear to particularly benefit from platinum chemotherapy compared with patients without inherited mutations. These patients may also benefit from other DNA repair targeted therapies such as poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.|Cancer
ID:30975996|Title:A requirement for STAG2 in replication fork progression creates a targetable synthetic lethality in cohesin-mutant cancers.Abstract:Cohesin is a multiprotein ring that is responsible for cohesion of sister chromatids and formation of DNA loops to regulate gene expression. Genomic analyses have identified that the cohesin subunit STAG2 is frequently inactivated by mutations in cancer. However, the reason STAG2 mutations are selected during tumorigenesis and strategies for therapeutically targeting mutant cancer cells are largely unknown. Here we show that STAG2 is essential for DNA replication fork progression, whereby STAG2 inactivation in non-transformed cells leads to replication fork stalling and collapse with disruption of interaction between the cohesin ring and the replication machinery as well as failure to establish SMC3 acetylation. As a consequence, STAG2 mutation confers synthetic lethality with DNA double-strand break repair genes and increased sensitivity to select cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and PARP or ATR inhibitors. These studies identify a critical role for STAG2 in replication fork procession and elucidate a potential therapeutic strategy for cohesin-mutant cancers.|Cancer
ID:30980196|Title:Molecular carcinogenesis of gastric cancer: Lauren classification, mucin phenotype expression, and cancer stem cells.Abstract:Gastric cancer (GC), one of the most common human cancers, is a heterogeneous disease with different phenotypes, prognoses, and responses to treatment. Understanding the pathogenesis of GC at the molecular level is important for prognosis prediction and determining treatments. Microsatellite instability (MSI), silencing of MLH1, MGMT, and CDKN2A genes by DNA hypermethylation, KRAS mutation, APC mutation, and ERBB2 amplification are frequently found in intestinal type GC. Inactivation of CDH1 and RARB by DNA hypermethylation, and amplification of FGFR and MET, are frequently detected in diffuse type GC. In addition, BST2 and PCDHB9 genes are overexpressed in intestinal type GC. Both genes are associated with GC progression. GC can be divided into gastric/intestinal mucin phenotypes according to mucin expression. MSI, alterations of TP73, CDH1 mutation, and DNA methylation of MLH are detected frequently in the gastric mucin phenotype. TP53 mutation, deletion of APC, and DNA methylation of MGMT are detected frequently in the intestinal mucin phenotype. FKTN is overexpressed in the intestinal mucin phenotype, and IQGAP3 is overexpressed in the gastric mucin phenotype. These genes are involved in GC progression. To characterize cancer stem cells, a useful method is spheroid colony formation. KIFC1 and KIF11 genes show more than twofold higher expression in spheroid-forming cells than that in parental cells. Both KIF genes are overexpressed in GC, and knockdown of these genes inhibits spheroid formation. Alterations of these molecules may be useful to understand gastric carcinogenesis. Specific inhibitors of these molecules may also be promising anticancer drugs.|Cancer
ID:30985412|Title:Comparison of L-Methyl-11C-Methionine PET With Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Detecting Newly Diagnosed Glioma.Abstract:AIMS: Amino acid PET and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are at the forefront of noninvasive imaging techniques used for detection and subtyping of glioma-suspicious lesions. In this pilot study, we compare L-methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS for their ability to predict glioma subtypes. METHODS: Nineteen patients with histologically, confirmed newly diagnosed glioma underwent preoperative L-methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS in 1 diagnostic session. According to the molecular portfolio and histopathologic diagnosis, patients were subdivided in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma, IDH wild-type grade II/III glioma, IDH-mutant grade II/III glioma without 1p/19q codeletion, and with 1p/19q codeletion subgroups. Maximum tumor-to-brain ratio (TBRmax), creatine, choline, and N-acetyl aspartate peaks were correlated with postoperative histopathologic tumor diagnoses. RESULTS: Maximum tumor-to-brain ratio was highest in glioblastoma patients (4.18) followed by patients with IDH wild-type grade II and III glioma (3.41). The latter TBRmax values were higher compared with those in patients with IDH-mutant grade II/III glioma without 1p/19q codeletion (1.95) and in patients with IDH-mutant 1p/19q codeleted grade II and III glioma (2.79). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy marker distribution showed no clear trend. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed TBRmax to be the best performing parameter in identifying IDH status (area under the curve, 0.67) and all spectroscopy markers combined in identifying glioma subgroups (area under the curve, 0.68), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: L-Methyl-C-methionine PET and MRS bear limited potential in glioma subgrouping. L-Methyl-C-methionine PET appears to be superior in differentiating IDH status, whereas MRS is more helpful in glioma subgrouping.|Cancer
ID:30987226|Title:Pathological and Molecular Features of Glioblastoma and Its Peritumoral Tissue.Abstract:Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and lethal human brain tumors. At present, GBMs are divided in primary and secondary on the basis of the mutational status of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes. In addition, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are considered crucial to better define the prognosis. Although primary and secondary GBMs are histologically indistinguishable, they retain distinct genetic alterations that account for different evolution of the tumor. The high invasiveness, the propensity to disperse throughout the brain parenchyma, and the elevated vascularity make these tumors extremely recidivist, resulting in a short patient median survival even after surgical resection and chemoradiotherapy. Furthermore, GBM is considered an immunologically cold tumor. Several studies highlight a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that promotes recurrence and poor prognosis. Deeper insight into the tumor immune microenvironment, together with the recent discovery of a conventional lymphatic system in the central nervous system (CNS), led to new immunotherapeutic strategies. In the last two decades, experimental evidence from different groups proved the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), also known as tumor-initiating cells, that may play an active role in tumor development and progression. Recent findings also indicated the presence of highly infiltrative CSCs in the peritumoral region of GBM. This region appears to play a key role in tumor growing and recurrence. However, until recently, few studies investigated the biomolecular characteristics of the peritumoral tissue. The aim of this review is to recapitulate the pathological features of GBM and of the peritumoral region associated with progression and recurrence.|Cancer
ID:30987669|Title:LINC01354 interacting with hnRNP-D contributes to the proliferation and metastasis in colorectal cancer through activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified to play an important role in the development and progression of various tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the regulatory molecular mechanism by lncRNA in CRC initiation and progression has not been fully clarified. METHODS: TCGA database was used to identify the involvement of LINC01354 in CRC. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to determine RNA and protein expression. The gain- and loss-of-function assays were conducted to explore the function of LINC01354 in the progression of CRC. In order to investigate the LINC01354-mediated mRNA in CRC tumorigenesis, we applied the profiling analysis as well as GO and KEGG analysis. Pulldown and RIP assays were applied to detect the interaction of hnRNP-D with LINC01354 and beta-catenin. RESULTS: The upregulation of LINC01354 in CRC and its prognostic significance were identified by TCGA database and confirmed in CRC tissues. Functionally, forced expression of LINC01354 promoted, while knockdown of LINC01354 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and EMT phenotype formation of CRC cells. A significant enrichment of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway genes under LINC01354 overexpression. In addition, LINC01354 modulated the mRNA stability of beta-catenin through interacting with hnRNP-D, thereby activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigations proposed novel regulatory axis of LINC01354/hnRNP-D/Wnt/beta-catenin, which might be in favor of exploring novel therapeutic regimens for the clinical treatment of CRC.|Cancer
ID:30989185|Title:Isolated Bone Marrow Non-Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis Preceding RUNX1-Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Case Report and Literature Review.Abstract:OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of concomitant myeloid neoplasms was recently reported to be unexpectedly high among adults without non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis (non-LCH); however, the coexistence of non-LCH with RUNX1 genetic aberration has not been reported previously. METHODS: Herein, we report a 23-year-old woman with severe pancytopenia diagnosed with non-LCH following presentation with pancytopenia and marrow examination showing histiocytosis positive for CD45, CD68, CD136, and lysozyme but negative for CD1a, langerin, and S100. RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing showed RUNX1 mutation and NF1 mutation. In the ensuing 6 months, she developed hepatosplenomegaly, and repeat bone marrow evaluation was diagnostic of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Repeat mutational analysis showed again presence of RUNX1 mutation. She underwent induction therapy but died of septic shock. CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration of RUNX1 mutation in both non-LCH and AML bone marrow specimens at differing time points is suggestive of a biologic association of both distinct disease entities.|Cancer
ID:30989623|Title:Survival and prognostic factors in surgically treated brain metastases.Abstract:PURPOSE: While surgery and radiation remain the mainstays of therapy for all patients with brain metastases (BM), the management is moving to a more individualized approach based on the underlying tumor. We sought to identify prognostic factors of both intracranial progression (IC-PFS) and overall survival (OS) in a surgical cohort. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1015 patients treated surgically for BM at Brigham and Women's Hospital (2007-2017). Kaplan-Meier curves were used for OS and IC-PFS and Cox proportional hazards models were built to assess for predictive factors. RESULTS: Common origins were lung (43.9%), breast (14.4%), and melanoma (13.8%). Median OS for the cohort was 15.4 months (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 14.1-17.1). Breast cancer (22.1 months, 95%CI 17.8-30.3) and colorectal cancer (10.6 months, 95%CI 7.2-15.4) had the longest and shortest OS, respectively. On multivariable Cox regression, significant prognostic factors of shorter OS were age (HR 1.01, 95%CI 1.01-1.02), number of lesions (HR 1.56, 95%CI 1.28-1.89), extracranial spread at BM diagnosis (HR 1.26, 95%CI 1.05-1.52), and KPS (HR 0.98, 95%CI 0.98-0.99). Regarding molecular factors, all driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma had a favorable effect (EGFR, HR 0.53, 95%CI 0.31-0.89; ALK, HR 0.28, 95%CI 0.12-0.66; KRAS, HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.47-0.92), triple negative status predicted poor prognosis in breast adenocarcinoma (HR 2.04, 95%CI 1.13-3.69), while no effect of BRAF/NRAS mutations was demonstrated in melanoma BMs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results corroborate the role of tumor origin and systemic as well as intracranial spread in OS. Heterogeneity within histologies was further explained by molecular alterations.|Cancer
ID:30990879|Title:Differential Expression of Wilms' Tumor Protein in Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma.Abstract:Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) are deadly tumors comprising 10%-15% of all childhood CNS cancers. Standard treatment is considered palliative and prognosis is near universal mortality. DIPGs have been classified into genomic subtypes based on histone variants with the lysine to methionine mutation on position 27 of histone tails (K27M). Given the increasing promise of immunotherapy, there have been ongoing efforts to identify tumor-specific antigens to serve as immunologic targets. We evaluated a large cohort of CNS specimens for Wilms' tumor protein (WT1) expression. These specimens include primary pediatric CNS tumors (n = 38 midline gliomas and n = 3 non-midline gliomas; n = 23 DIPG, n = 10 low-grade gliomas, n = 8 high-grade gliomas), and DIPG primary cells. Here, we report the validation of WT1 as a tumor-associated antigen in DIPGs. We further report that WT1 expression is significantly correlated with specific oncohistone variants, with the highest expression detected in the H3.3K27M subgroup. WT1 expression was absent in all control specimens (n = 21). Western blot assays using DIPG primary cells (n = 6) showed a trend of higher WT1 expression in H3.3K27M cells when compared with H3.1 K27M cells and H3 wildtype cells. Our data are the first indication of the association between WT1 and DIPG, with specific upregulation in those harboring oncohistone H3.3K27M.|Cancer
ID:30992265|Title:Recommendations for the management of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in adults.Abstract:Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe hyperinflammatory syndrome induced by aberrantly activated macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. The primary (genetic) form, caused by mutations affecting lymphocyte cytotoxicity and immune regulation, is most common in children, whereas the secondary (acquired) form is most frequent in adults. Secondary HLH is commonly triggered by infections or malignancies but may also be induced by autoinflammatory/autoimmune disorders, in which case it is called macrophage activation syndrome (MAS; or MAS-HLH). Most information on the diagnosis and treatment of HLH comes from the pediatric literature. Although helpful in some adult cases, this raises several challenges. For example, the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria developed for children are commonly applied but are not validated for adults. Another challenge in HLH diagnosis is that patients may present with a phenotype indistinguishable from sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Treatment algorithms targeting hyperinflammation are frequently based on pediatric protocols, such as HLH-94 and HLH-2004, which may result in overtreatment and unnecessary toxicity in adults. Therefore, dose reductions, individualized tailoring of treatment duration, and an age-dependent modified diagnostic approach are to be considered. Here, we present expert opinions derived from an interdisciplinary working group on adult HLH, sponsored by the Histiocyte Society, to facilitate knowledge transfer between physicians caring for pediatric and adult patients with HLH, with the aim to improve the outcome for adult patients affected by HLH.|Cancer
ID:30996350|Title:Targeting LIF-mediated paracrine interaction for pancreatic cancer therapy and monitoring.Abstract:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis largely owing to inefficient diagnosis and tenacious drug resistance. Activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and consequent development of dense stroma are prominent features accounting for this aggressive biology1,2. The reciprocal interplay between PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) not only enhances tumour progression and metastasis but also sustains their own activation, facilitating a vicious cycle to exacerbate tumorigenesis and drug resistance3-7. Furthermore, PSC activation occurs very early during PDAC tumorigenesis8-10, and activated PSCs comprise a substantial fraction of the tumour mass, providing a rich source of readily detectable factors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the communication between PSCs and PCCs could be an exploitable target to develop effective strategies for PDAC therapy and diagnosis. Here, starting with a systematic proteomic investigation of secreted disease mediators and underlying molecular mechanisms, we reveal that leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a key paracrine factor from activated PSCs acting on cancer cells. Both pharmacologic LIF blockade and genetic Lifr deletion markedly slow tumour progression and augment the efficacy of chemotherapy to prolong survival of PDAC mouse models, mainly by modulating cancer cell differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition status. Moreover, in both mouse models and human PDAC, aberrant production of LIF in the pancreas is restricted to pathological conditions and correlates with PDAC pathogenesis, and changes in the levels of circulating LIF correlate well with tumour response to therapy. Collectively, these findings reveal a function of LIF in PDAC tumorigenesis, and suggest its translational potential as an attractive therapeutic target and circulating marker. Our studies underscore how a better understanding of cell-cell communication within the tumour microenvironment can suggest novel strategies for cancer therapy.|Cancer
ID:30997549|Title:[Pituitary adenomas].Abstract:Despite characteristic symptoms the diagnosis of clinically relevant pituitary adenomas is often delayed until an advanced stage due to the rarity of the disease. The typical clinical manifestations are presented in this review article. The recent discovery of the USP8 mutation in Cushing's disease and of X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG) syndrome in early onset gigantism were milestones in the search for the molecular etiology of pituitary adenomas. The triad of endocrinological, radiological and ophthalmological diagnostics are the main pillars for the diagnostic work-up of pituitary adenomas. The standard treatment modalities, which include surgery, medical treatment and irradiation, have been further developed and refined. For transsphenoidal excision of pituitary adenomas, microsurgery and endoscopy are two equivalent surgical techniques with relatively few complications. Surgery represents the first-line treatment of pituitary adenomas. Prolactinomas are an exception as the medical treatment with dopamine agonists is highly efficient. Nowadays, new medical treatment options are available for acromegaly and Cushing's disease and are used for second-line treatment. The alkylating chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide is used for the first-line chemotherapy of rare aggressively growing pituitary adenomas. Irradiation is indicated if surgical and medical treatment options are insufficiently successful. Stereotactic one-stage irradiation (radiosurgery) is especially suitable for well-demarcated invasive residual or recurrent adenomas in the cavernous sinus. A new development is hypofractionated radiosurgery for protection of structures at risk. Fractionated irradiation is necessary with large radiation volumes and for pituitary adenomas with a close proximity to the optic tract.|Cancer
ID:30998136|Title:[Mutation Spectrum of FANCJ Gene in Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia].Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To detect and analyze the mutation status of FANCJ gene in adult AML patients, so as to provide the basis for studying the mechanism of FANCJ driven AML and guiding the preventim and treatment of deseese. METHODS: The cDNAs were extracted and transeripted from bone marrow cells and normal skin cells in 222 newly diagnosed AML patients. The primers were designed for FANCJ gene coding region, the mutations of FANCJ gene coding region in AML patients as well as the mutations of FANCJ gene in mucous membrane epethelia in patients were detected by PCR and sanger seguencing; the evolutionary conservation of FANCJ mutation in different organisms was analyzed by NCBI Blast online bioinformaties software. RESULTS: The sequencing analysis showed that the mutations of FANCJ gene happened in 11 sites of FANCJ gene coding region, which were as followed: exon5:c.G430A:p.A144T, exon6:c.A587G:pN196S, exon9:c.C1255T:p.R419W, exon10:c.G1442A:p.G481D, exon11:c.C1609G:p.L537V, exon16:c.C2360T:p.P787L, exon17:c.C2440T:p.R814C, exon19:c.C2608T:pH870Y, exon19:c.A2686G:p.I896V, exon19:c.C2830G:p.Q944E, exon20:c.G3412A:p.D1138N. Among them, the repeatability existed in mutations of A144T, N196S, R814C, I896V and Q944E. Beside, the mutation sites of A144, R419, G381, L537, P787, H870, Q944 and D1138 were highly conserved in different organisms. CONCLUSION: Among 222 adult AML patients, the mutations of FANCJ gene have been found in 26 patients, moreover, the mutation sites are relatively conserved in different organisms, and possess important fanction. The results of this study provide the basis for exploring the mexhanism of FANCJ gene driven AML and for guiding the prevantion and treatment of AML.|Cancer
ID:31000705|Title:AURKB as a target in non-small cell lung cancer with acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy.Abstract:Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors harboring mutations in EGFR ultimately relapse to therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs). Here, we show that resistant cells without the p.T790M or other acquired mutations are sensitive to the Aurora B (AURKB) inhibitors barasertib and S49076. Phospho-histone H3 (pH3), a major product of AURKB, is increased in most resistant cells and treatment with AURKB inhibitors reduces the levels of pH3, triggering G1/S arrest and polyploidy. Senescence is subsequently induced in cells with acquired mutations while, in their absence, polyploidy is followed by cell death. Finally, in NSCLC patients, pH3 levels are increased after progression on EGFR TKIs and high pH3 baseline correlates with shorter survival. Our results reveal that AURKB activation is associated with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, and that AURKB constitutes a potential target in NSCLC progressing to anti-EGFR therapy and not carrying resistance mutations.|Cancer
ID:31002019|Title:Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma is associated with BRCA2 germline mutations: a case report and literature review.Abstract:Acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) is a rare pancreatic neoplasm with dismal prognosis. Insights into the molecular basis of ACC can pave the way for the application of more effective, personalized therapies and detection of patients with hereditary predisposition. Molecular analysis revealed a germline BRCA2 (and CHEK2) mutation in a patient with a rare pancreatic ACC with extensive intraductal growth. Somatic loss of the wild-type BRCA2 allele in the tumor indicated the causal relationship of ACC with the germline defect. A thorough literature review identified another nine ACCs associated with germline BRCA2 mutation and two ACCs associated with germline BRCA1 mutation, resulting in a prevalence of BRCA1/2 germline mutations in almost 7% of ACCs. Moreover, somatic BRCA1/2 alterations are reported in 16% of sporadic ACCs. Overall, about one fifth (22%) of all pancreatic ACCs exhibit BRCA1/2 deficiency. This study underscores the important role of BRCA1/2 mutations in pancreatic ACC. All ACC patients should undergo genetic testing for BRCA1/2 mutations to identify carriers of pathogenic variants. This will allow to select patients that can benefit from targeted therapies directed against BRCA1/2-deficient tumors and is also crucial as a referral to genetic screening for the relatives of affected individuals carrying germline BRCA1/2 alterations. Abbreviations: ACC: acinar cell carcinoma; HBOC: Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer; LOH: loss of heterozygosity; PARP: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; PDAC: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; PP: pancreatic panniculitis; SD: standard deviation; WES: whole-exome sequencing.|Cancer
ID:31002364|Title:JAK3/STAT3 oncogenic pathway and PRDM1 expression stratify clinicopathologic features of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type.Abstract:The inactivation of tumor suppressor gene positive regulatory domain containing I (PRDM1) and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) have been detected in the majority of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (EN-NK/T-NT) cases. In the present study, their association with and effects on the clinicopathologic features of EN-NK/T-NT are described. PRDM1 was revealed to be expressed in 19 out of 58 patients (32.8%) with EN-NK/T-NT, and phosphorylated STAT3 was overexpressed in 42 out of 58 (72.4%). Oncogenic pathways were investigated by NanoString encounter technology in 5 PRDM1(+) and 5 PRDM1(-) EN-NK/T-NT specimens. Multiple oncogenic pathways involved in cell apoptosis, cellcycle (CC) and angiogenesis were discriminately activated in EN-NK/T-NT cases, and in PRDM1(+) cases in particular. The sustained activation of the Janus kinase 3 (JAK)/STAT3 pathway was more pronounced. In addition, missense mutations in the SRC homology 2 domain of STAT3 were detected in 7 out of 37 EN-NK/T-NT cases (18.92%), and the acquired mutation was related to the activation of the JAK3/STAT3 pathway. The downregulation of PRDM1 and upregulation of phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) were associated with angiocentric infiltration of EN-NK/T-NT (P=0.039). Notably, the prognosis of patients in the PRDM1(+)/STAT3 [mutated (mut-)] group was considerably improved than that of patients in the STAT3(mut+)/PRDM(-) group (P=0.037). In addition, the inhibition of NK/T cell lymphoma cell lines by Stattic and tofacitinib could suppress cell proliferation by inducing cell apoptosis or arresting the CC. The present results revealed that the JAK3/STAT3 oncogenic pathway and PRDM1 expression could stratify clinicopathologic features of EN-NK/T-NT. The inhibition of the JAK3/STAT3 pathway may serve as a treatment option for EN-NK/T-NT.|Cancer
ID:31006323|Title:Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound image fusion guidance of prostate biopsies: current status, challenges and future perspectives.Abstract:The use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis is rapidly evolving to try to overcome the limitations of the current diagnostic pathway using systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies (TRUSbx) for all men with clinical suspicion of PCa. Prostate mpMRI allows for high quality lesion detection and characterization and has been shown to improve detection of significant PCa with a more accurate Gleason score grading. Suspicious lesions can be stratified by suspicion and sampled by selective MRI-guided targeted biopsies (TBx) for improved diagnostic accuracy. Several TBx methods have been established and include MRI/TRUS image fusion biopsies (cognitive or software-assisted) and in-bore biopsies, but none have yet proven superior in clinical practice. However, while MRI in-bore biopsy is not routinely used due to its costs and limited availability, MRI/TRUS image fusion is rapidly embraced as it allows skilled urologists to perform TBx in an outpatient clinic. Furthermore, it gives the operator the advantage of adding TBx to the systematic standard biopsy scheme, which is the currently recommended approach. With the anticipated increased future use of prebiopsy mpMRI, a more widespread implementation of MRI/TRUS image fusion platforms is concurrently expected in clinical practice. Therefore, the objective of this review is to assess the current status, challenges and future perspectives of prostate MRI/TRUS image fusion biopsies.|Cancer
ID:31008966|Title:Spontaneous rotational dislocation of the lumbar spine in type 1 neurofibromatosis: A case report and literature review.Abstract:RATIONALE: Scoliosis is the most common form of dystrophic spinal deformities in type 1 neurofibromatosis, whereas a spontaneous rotational dislocation of the lumbar spine is a rare entity. Former researchers had advocated the use of circumferential fusion performed through combined anterior-posterior approaches as the mode of treatment of this situation, but we managed to achieve a solid circumferential fusion equally using posterior approach alone. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 51-year-old lady presented with severe back pain and no history of trauma, fever, or loss of weight. On examination, she showed several cafe-au-lait spots on her body and no neurologic deficit. DIAGNOSES: The imageology revealed a rotational dislocation of the L2 to L3. The diagnosis of neurofibroma was confirmed by biopsy. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent posterior reduction, combined intervertebral-posterolateral fusion, and internal fixation with screws and rods. OUTCOMES: The patient was satisfied with the back pain relief after surgery and able to live a normal life at follow-up. The imageology showed a good correction of the deformity with a solid bony fusion. LESSONS: Special attention must be paid to patients who have neurofibromatosis and unexplained back pain for early diagnosis. Early circumferential fusion to reconstruct a stable spine is the key to treatment. Given the result of this case, the prognosis is promising following posterior surgery alone.|Cancer

While it remains controversial as to whether estrogen plays a role in focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangioma or hamartoma, exposure to oral contraceptive pills and estrogen has a strong association with hepatic adenomas. Four different subgroups of adenomas have been described: Inflammatory, HNF-1alpha-mutated, beta-catenin-mutated and unclassified. Vascular complications may include Budd-Chiari syndrome, vascular thrombosis, dilated sinusoids and peliosis.|Cancer
ID:31013001|Title:Clinical impact of testing for mutations and microRNAs in thyroid nodules.Abstract:BACKGROUND: We report results of a multicenter clinical experience study examining the likelihood of patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules to undergo surgery or have malignant outcome based on multiplatform combination mutation and microRNA testing (MPT). METHODS: MPT assessed mutations in BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, and PIK3CA genes, PAX8/PPARgamma, RET/PTC1, and RET/PTC3 gene rearrangements, and the expression of 10 microRNAs. Baseline clinical information at the time of MPT and clinical follow-up records were reviewed for 337 patients, of which 80% had negative MPT results. Kaplan Meier analysis for cumulative probability of survival without having a surgical procedure or malignant diagnosis over the course of patient follow-up was determined for MPT results of 180 patients, among which only 14% had malignancy. RESULTS: A negative MPT result in nodules with Bethesda III or IV cytology (2009) conferred a high probability of non-surgical treatment, with only 11% expected to undergo surgery and a high probability of survival without malignancy (92%) for up to 2 years follow up. A positive MPT result conferred a 57% probability of malignancy and was an independent risk factor for undergoing surgical treatment (Hazard Ratio [HR] 9.2, 95% confidence intervals 5.4-15.9, P < .0001) and for malignancy (HR 13.4, 95% confidence intervals 4.8-37.2, P < .0001). For nodules with weak driver mutations, positive microRNA test results supported high risk of cancer while negative results downgraded cancer risk. CONCLUSION: MPT results are predictive of real-world decisions to surgically treat indeterminate thyroid nodules, with those decisions being appropriately aligned with a patient's risk of malignancy over time.|Cancer
ID:31016433|Title:The composition of T cell infiltrates varies in primary invasive breast cancer of different molecular subtypes as well as according to tumor size and nodal status.Abstract:T lymphocytes are the most numerous immune cells in tumor-associated infiltrates and include several subpopulations of either anticancer or pro-tumorigenic functions. However, the associations between levels of different T cell subsets and breast cancer molecular subtypes as well as other prognostic factors have not been fully established yet. We performed immunohistochemistry for CD8 (cytotoxic T cells (CTL)), FOXP3 (regulatory T cells (Tregs)), and GATA3 (Th2 cells) in 106 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded invasive breast cancer tissue samples and analyzed both the numbers and percentages of investigated cells in tumor-associated infiltrates. We observed that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2+ non-luminal breast tumors were associated with more numerous CTLs and Tregs and a higher Treg/Th2 cell ratio as compared with luminal A subtype. A higher Treg percentage was related to a decreased hormone receptor expression, an increase in the Ki67 level, a greater tumor size of luminal tumors, and the presence of lymph node metastases. Moreover, differences in the composition of T cell infiltrates were associated with HER2 status and histologic grade and type, and a distinct immune pattern was observed in tumors of different phenotypes regarding pT stage and nodal status. The results of our work show the diversity of T cell infiltrates in primary invasive breast cancers of different phenotypes and suggest that progression of luminal or non-luminal tumors is related to distinct tumor-associated T cell composition.|Cancer
ID:31019896|Title:Genetic Profile and Clinical Implications of Hepatoblastoma and Neuroblastoma Coexistence in a Child.Abstract:The aim of the following case report is to provide a description of the coexistence of two independent tumors in a child. A 9-month-old male was referred to Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology with hepatic tumor present on ultrasound imaging and symptoms of enlarged abdominal circumference. Physical examination revealed a palpable epigastric mass and the imaging techniques showed a tumor of the left hepatic lobe measuring 11 x 6.5 x 8.9 cm with pancreas infiltration, distant metastases in both lungs and abnormal lesion in the left adrenal gland. Basing on histopathological examination, after a core-needle biopsy, hepatoblastoma (HBL) (mixed epithelial-mesenchymal subtype) was diagnosed. The alpha-fetoprotein level was 112 993 ng/ml. Elevated values of normetanephrine, 3-methoxytyramine as well as neuron-specific enolase were observed. Due to the clinical picture and diagnosis, the patient was qualified to preoperative chemotherapy according to the SIOPEL-3 protocol, followed by SIOPEL-4 protocol for the high-risk patients. After undergoing preoperative chemotherapy, imaging tests revealed regression of hepatic tumor and no focal pulmonary masses, while regression of adrenal gland mass was not completed. The patient was qualified for left hemihepatectomy with left adrenalectomy. Histopathological examination of liver specimen confirmed the HBL diagnosis. However, in left adrenal gland and paraaortic lymph nodes the residual neuroblastoma (NBL) cells were detected. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was utilized to identify disease-associated germline mutations. WES revealed a novel germline insertion variant in TWIST1 (p.Gly86dup), along with the potentially pathogenic non-synonymous variants in NF1 (p.Val2511Ile), RAF1 (p.Leu445Arg), and WHSC1 (p.Ser4Asn) genes. Currently, 6 months after completion of treatment according to the SIOPEL-4 protocol, the patient is in good general condition, without any signs, and symptoms of relapse of both neoplasms. The coexistence of two different primary childhood malignancies is rarely seen. So far, only one case of synchronous HBL and NBL has been reported. However, for the first time therapeutic process was successful. A specific signature of rare germline mutations can be proposed as a predisposing factor to synchronous HBL and NBL occurrence.|Cancer
ID:31023294|Title:A case report of revision occipital-cervical fusion after atlanto-axial instrumentation failure for neurofibromatosis type I.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant genetic disease with characteristic cafe-au-lait spots, neurofibroma, and dystrophic changes in the bones. However, complications involving atlanto-axial dislocation are rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of neurofibromatosis with atlanto-axial dislocation. The chief complaints were numbness of the upper limb and gait disturbance. We performed short fusion using the Brooks method. However, recurrence of the dislocation was found after 5 months recovery, and the patient underwent posterior fusion from the occipital bone to C4. Thereafter, she had a good postoperative course. CONCLUSIONS: Neurofibromatosis patients often exhibit a low bone mineral density because of dystrophic changes, and are prone to fragile bones. In the present case, the use of long fusion at the first surgery may have helped to form a strong fusion of fragile bone.|Cancer
ID:31025086|Title:Integrated diagnostics of diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial gliomas are the most common neuroepithelial tumors. Their classification is based on the integration of histological and molecular findings according to the classification of tumors of the central nervous system published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016. OBJECTIVES: This review describes the different entities and variants of diffuse gliomas and summarizes the current diagnostic criteria for these tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the 2016 WHO classification and selected other publications, the histomolecular diagnostics of diffuse gliomas is presented and illustrated. RESULTS: Diffuse gliomas are divided into isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant or IDH-wildtype gliomas by detection of mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 genes. Among the IDH-mutant gliomas, oligodendroglial tumors are characterized by combined losses of chromosome arms 1p and 19q. Loss of nuclear expression of the ATRX protein is a marker of IDH- mutant astrocytic gliomas. Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, is the most common diffuse glioma. Diffuse and anaplastic astrocytic gliomas without IDH mutation should be further evaluated for molecular features of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. Diffuse gliomas in the thalamus, brainstem, or spinal cord carrying a histone 3 (H3)-K27M mutation are classified as diffuse midline gliomas, H3-K27M-mutant. By determining the IDH and 1p/19q status, oligoastrocytomas can be stratified into either astrocytic or oligodendroglial gliomas. Gliomatosis cerebri is no longer regarded as a distinct glioma entity. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse gliomas can today be classified accurately and reproducibly by means of histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular analyses.|Cancer
ID:31026246|Title:Impact of initial stage on metastatic melanoma survival.Abstract:Patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma have varied clinical courses, even in patients with similar disease characteristics. We examine the impact of initial stage of melanoma diagnosis, BRAF status of primary melanoma, and receiving adjuvant therapy on postmetastatic overall survival (pmOS). We studied melanoma patients presenting to Perlmutter Cancer Center at New York University and prospectively enrolled in New York University melanoma biospecimen database and followed up on protocol-driven schedule. Patients were stratified by stage at initial melanoma diagnosis as per AJCC 7th ed. guidelines. pmOS was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional hazards models were used to assess hazard ratios (HRs). Three hundred and four out of 3204 patients developed metastatic disease over the time of follow-up (median follow-up 2.2 years, range: 0.08-35.2 years). Patients diagnosed with stage I (n=96) melanoma had longer pmOS (29.5 months) than those diagnosed with stage II (n=99, pmOS 14.9 months) or stage III (n=109, pmOS 15.1 months) melanoma (P=0.036). Initial stage of diagnosis remained significant in multivariate analysis when controlling for lactate dehydrogenase and site of metastases [primary diagnosis stage II (HR 1.44, P=0.046), stage III (HR 1.5, P=0.019)]. Adjuvant treatment was associated with better survival but BRAF mutation status did not show an association. Our data challenge the general assumption that primary melanomas converge upon diagnosis of metastatic disease and behave uniformly. Primary stage of melanoma at the time of diagnosis may be prognostic of outcome, similar to lactate dehydrogenase and metastatic disease sites.|Cancer
ID:31027701|Title:Improvement in the survival of patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer: Experience in a single institutional 1995-2017.Abstract:OBJECTIVES: In the past two decades several antineoplastic agents have been approved for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the management of these patients has drastically changed. However, there is limited information regarding the impact of these advances on patient survival in clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the survival of patients with stage IV NSCLC who received any treatment in the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research (JFCR) between January 1, 1995 and March 1, 2017. A total of 1,547 consecutive patients were included in this case series. In this analysis, five diagnostic periods were evaluated: 1995-1999 (period A), 2000-2004 (period B), 2005-2009 (period C), 2010-2014 (period D), and 2015-2017 (period E). We compared overall survival (OS) between the periods before and after propensity score matching (PSM) and in patients with EGFR mutation, with ALK fusion gene, or without driver mutation. RESULTS: In the past two decades the OS of patients with stage IV NSCLC improved. The median OSs for periods A, B, C, D, and E were 9.0, 11.0, 13.7, 17.9 months, and not reached, respectively. After PSM with known baseline characteristics, the trend of improvement in OS was similar. However, the OS of patients with EGFR mutation or ALK fusion gene did not improve between periods, despite the availability of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Japan. The OS of patients without a driver mutation was slightly longer in the period E. CONCLUSION: The introduction of new classes of drugs has significantly improved the survival of patients with stage IV NSCLC. However, the approval of similar types of drugs may not be associated with further improvement in survival.|Cancer
ID:31027705|Title:A retrospective cohort study of PD-L1 prevalence, molecular associations and clinical outcomes in patients with NSCLC: Results from the European Thoracic Oncology Platform (ETOP) Lungscape Project.Abstract:INTRODUCTION: The PD-L1 biomarker is an important factor in selecting patients with non-small cell lung cancer for immunotherapy. While several reports suggest that PD-L1 positivity is linked to a poor prognosis, others suggest that PD-L1 positive status portends a good prognosis. METHODS: PD-L1 positivity prevalence, assessed via immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarrays (TMAs), and its association with clinicopathological characteristics, molecular profiles and patient outcome- Relapse-free Survival (RFS), Time-to-Relapse (TTR) and Overall Survival (OS)- is explored in the ETOP Lungscape cohort of stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tumors are considered positive if they have >=1/5/25/50% neoplastic cell membrane staining. RESULTS: PD-L1 expression was assessed in 2182 NSCLC cases (2008 evaluable, median follow-up 4.8 years, 54.6% still alive), from 15 ETOP centers. Adenocarcinomas represent 50.9% of the cohort (squamous cell: 42.4%). Former smokers are 53.7% (current: 31.6%, never: 10.5%). PD-L1 positivity prevalence is present in more than one third of the Lungscape cohort (1%/5% cut-offs). It doesn't differ between adenocarcinomas and squamous cell histologies, but is more frequently detected in higher stages, never smokers, larger tumors (1/5/25% cut-offs). With >=1% cut-off it is significantly associated with IHC MET overexpression, expression of PTEN, EGFR and KRAS mutation (only for adenocarcinoma). Results for 5%, 25% and 50% cut-offs were similar, with MET being significantly associated with PD-L1 positivity both for AC (p < 0.001, 5%/25%/50% cut-offs) and SCC (p < 0.001, 5% & 50% cut-offs and p = 0.0017 for 25%). When adjusting for clinicopathological characteristics, a significant prognostic effect was identified in adenocarcinomas (adjusted p-values: 0.024/0.064/0.063 for RFS/TTR/OS 1% cut-off, analogous for 5%/25%, but not for 50%). Similar results obtained for the model including all histologies, but no effect was found for the squamous cell carcinomas. CONCLUSION: PD-L1 positivity, when adjusted for clinicopathological characteristics, is associated with a better prognosis for non-metastatic adenocarcinoma patients.|Cancer

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2016 to December 2018, 256 men with a PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System) score 3 (80 cases) or 4 (176 cases) and negative repeat transperineal saturation biopsy plus TPBx, underwent a new TPBx (four cores) for the persistent clinical suspicion of cancer. The accuracy of mpMRI ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) values in the diagnosis of csPCa were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall detection rate of csPCa was equal to 10.1% (26/256 cases): 2.5% (2/80) versus 13.6% (24/176) had a PI-RADS score equal to 3 versus 4, respectively. The presence of csPCa was significantly correlated with an ADC value of 0.747x10-3 mm2/sec. CONCLUSION: A negative TBPx missed a csPCa in 13.6% of PI-RADS score 4 that was diagnosed by an early second round TBPx; the evaluation of ADC maps could select mpMRI lesions deserving a repeat TPBx.|Cancer
ID:31029168|Title:Targeted capture-based NGS is superior to multiplex PCR-based NGS for hereditary BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene analysis in FFPE tumor samples.Abstract:BACKGROUND: With the introduction of Olaparib treatment for BRCA-deficient recurrent ovarian cancer, testing for somatic and/or germline mutations in BRCA1/2 genes in tumor tissues became essential for treatment decisions. In most cases only formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, containing fragmented and chemically modified DNA of minor quality, are available. Thus, multiplex PCR-based sequencing is most commonly applied in routine molecular testing, which is predominantly focused on the identification of known hot spot mutations in oncogenes. METHODS: We compared the overall performance of an adjusted targeted capture-based enrichment protocol and a multiplex PCR-based approach for calling of pathogenic SNVs and InDels using DNA extracted from 13 FFPE tissue samples. We further applied both strategies to seven blood samples and five matched FFPE tumor tissues of patients with known germline exon-spanning deletions and gene-wide duplications in BRCA1/2 to evaluate CNV detection based solely on panel NGS data. Finally, we analyzed DNA from FFPE tissues of 11 index patients from families suspected of having hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, of whom no blood samples were available for testing, in order to identify underlying pathogenic germline BRCA1/2 mutations. RESULTS: The multiplex PCR-based protocol produced inhomogeneous coverage among targets of each sample and between samples as well as sporadic amplicon drop out, leading to insufficiently or non-covered nucleotides, which subsequently hindered variant detection. This protocol further led to detection of PCR-artifacts that could easily have been misinterpreted as pathogenic mutations. No such limitations were observed by application of an adjusted targeted capture-based protocol, which allowed for CNV calling with 86% sensitivity and 100% specificity. All pathogenic CNVs were confirmed in the five matched FFPE tumor samples from patients carrying known pathogenic germline mutations and we additionally identified somatic loss of the second allele in BRCA1/2. Furthermore we detected pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants in four the eleven FFPE samples from patients of whom no blood was available for analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that an adjusted targeted capture-based enrichment protocol is superior to commonly applied multiplex PCR-based protocols for reliable BRCA1/2 variant detection, including CNV-detection, using FFPE tumor samples.|Cancer
ID:31029439|Title:[Study of anogenital distance as a diagnostic tool for prostate cancer].Abstract:INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The distance from the genitals to the anus (anogenital distance [AGD]) reflects androgen concentration during prenatal development in mammals. At the present time, there is only one study suggesting the relationship between AGD and risk of prostate cancer (CaP). The goal of this study was to assess the performance and clinical utility of AGD, as a biomarker of prenatal androgenic milieu, and risk of CaP in a larger population, in CaP diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted on 260 men seen in a hospital outpatient clinic where underwent a physical and andrological examination and completed a brief questionnaire. CaP patients were confirmed by biopsy of the tumor. Controls were men without CaP seen in the urology outpatient clinic for routine examinations. Two variants of AGD (from the anus to the posterior base of the scrotum [AGDAS] and to the cephalad insertion of the penis [AGDAP]) were measured. Parametric and non-parametric tests and receiver operating characteristic (COR) analyses were used to determine relationships between AGD and presence of CaP. RESULTS: The highest area under the curve (0.69; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.78 and 0.69; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.77) was obtained for the Gleason=7 subgroup with the AGDAS and AGDAP measurement, with a sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 55%, and 91% and 41%, the predictive positive value of 39% and 35% and negative value of 90% and 93% respectively. CONCLUSION: AGD may be a useful clinical tool for the CaP diagnosis.|Cancer
ID:31032226|Title:A Novel Approach to Preoperative Risk Stratification in Endometrial Cancer: The Added Value of Immunohistochemical Markers.Abstract:Background: The current model used to preoperatively stratify endometrial cancer (EC) patients into low- and high-risk groups is based on histotype, grade, and imaging method and is not optimal. Our study aims to prove whether a new model incorporating immunohistochemical markers, L1CAM, ER, PR, p53, obtained from preoperative biopsy could help refine stratification and thus the choice of adequate surgical extent and appropriate adjuvant treatment. Materials and Methods: The following data were prospectively collected from patients operated for EC from January 2016 through August 2018: age, pre- and post-operative histology, grade, lymphovascular space invasion, L1CAM, ER, PR, p53, imaging parameters obtained from ultrasound, CT chest/abdomen, final FIGO stage, and current decision model (based on histology, grade, imaging method). Results: In total, 132 patients were enrolled. The current model revealed 48% sensitivity and 89% specificity for high-risk group determination. In myometrial invasion >50%, lower levels of ER (p = 0.024), PR (0.048), and higher levels of L1CAM (p = 0.001) were observed; in cervical involvement a higher expression of L1CAM (p = 0.001), lower PR (p = 0.014); in tumors with positive LVSI, higher L1CAM (p = 0.014); in cases with positive LN, lower expression of ER/PR (p < 0.001), higher L1CAM (p = 0.002) and frequent mutation of p53 (p = 0.008). Cut-offs for determination of high-risk tumors were established: ER <78% (p = 0.001), PR <88% (p = 0.008), and L1CAM >=4% (p < 0.001). The positive predictive values (PPV) for ER, PR, and L1CAM were 87% (60.8-96.5%), 63% (52.1-72.8%), 83% (70.5-90.8%); the negative predictive values (NPV) for each marker were as follows: 59% (54.5-63.4%), 65% (55.6-74.0%), and 77% (67.3-84.2%). Mutation of p53 revealed PPV 94% (67.4-99.1%) and NPV 61% (56.1-66.3%). When immunohistochemical markers were included into the current diagnostic model, sensitivity improved (48.4 vs. 75.8%, p < 0.001). PPV was similar for both methods, while NPV (i.e., the probability of extremely low risk in negative test cases) was improved (66 vs. 78.9%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: We proved superiority of new proposed model using immunohistochemical markers over standard clinical practice and that new proposed model increases accuracy of prognosis prediction. We propose wider implementation and validation of the proposed model.|Cancer
ID:31032472|Title:Genomic Assessment of Blood-Derived Circulating Tumor DNA in Patients With Colorectal Cancers: Correlation With Tissue Sequencing, Therapeutic Response, and Survival.Abstract:PURPOSE: Genomic alterations in blood-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients with colorectal cancers were correlated with clinical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Next-generation sequencing of ctDNA (54- to 73-gene panel) was performed in 94 patients with colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Most patients (96%) had metastatic or recurrent disease at the time of blood draw. The median number of nonsynonymous alterations per patient was three (range, zero to 30). The most frequently aberrant genes were TP53 (52.1% of patients), KRAS (34%), and APC (28.7%). Concordance between tissue and blood next-generation sequencing ranged from 63.2% (APC) to 85.5% (BRAF). Altogether, 74 patients (79%) had one or more nonsynonymous alterations, 69 (73%) had one or more potentially actionable alterations, and 61 (65%) had an alteration actionable by a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (on or off label). Lung metastases correlated with improved survival from diagnosis in univariable analysis. ctDNA of 5% or more from blood tests as well as EGFR and ERBB2 (HER2) nonsynonymous alterations correlated with worse survival (but only ERBB2 remained significant in multivariable analysis). No two patients had identical molecular portfolios. Overall, 65% versus 31% of patients treated with matched (n = 17) versus unmatched therapy (n = 18) after ctDNA testing achieved stable disease for 6 months or more, partial response, or complete response (P = .045); progression-free survival, 6.1 versus 2.3 months (P = .08); and survival not reached versus 9.4 months (P = .146; all by multivariable analysis). CONCLUSION: Patients with colorectal cancer have heterogeneous ctDNA profiles, and most harbor potentially actionable ctDNA alterations. Matched therapy yielded higher rates of stable disease for 6 months or more, partial response, or complete response. ctDNA assessment may have clinical utility and merits further investigation.|Cancer
ID:31032708|Title:Thyroid-Like Follicular Carcinoma of the Kidney With Extensive Sarcomatoid Differentiation: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.Abstract:Thyroid-like follicular carcinoma of the kidney (TLFCK) is an extremely rare primary renal malignancy that typically has an indolent course and good prognosis. Histologically, this tumor mimics follicular carcinoma of the thyroid; however, typical thyroid markers are negative. There are fewer than 40 cases reported in the literature, and thus, the prognosis and course of disease is not well understood. Sarcomatoid differentiation has never been reported in a case of TLFCK. We present a case of a 48-year-old woman with an aggressive TLFCK with extensive sarcomatoid differentiation and metastatic disease at presentation. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing of both the thyroid-like component and the poorly differentiated sarcomatoid component using our solid tumor panel to evaluate for any disease-associated mutations and to better understand the molecular profile of these tumors.|Cancer
ID:31032785|Title:An Update on Mucosal Melanoma: Future Directions.Abstract:By definition, mucosal melanomas are malignant primary tumors originating from melanocytes located in the mucosal membranes of the nasal cavity and accessory sinuses, oral cavity, lips and pharynx, and vulvar, vaginal or uterus, anorectal, or basically any other part of the mucosal surface lining. These malignant melanomas usually occur in occult sites, which in combination with the lack of early specific signs contributes to the delay in diagnosis and poor prognosis of the disease. Given the rarity of mucosal melanomas, knowledge about their pathogenesis and risk factors is insufficient and when compared with cutaneous and ocular melanoma, they have the lowest five-year survival rate. Surgical resection is frequently the first approach to primary tumors, even though the utility of lymph node surgery and radiation therapy is not well established. Novel molecular techniques such as whole exome sequencing have become routine in order to aid patient care. They show great promise in the treatment of rare and usually fatal diseases such as mucosal melanomas. Target therapy against c-KIT activating mutations, frequently seen in mucosal melanomas, and the immunotherapy have emerged as a promising treatment modality for these aggressive tumors.|Cancer
ID:31033100|Title:Association between certain non-small cell lung cancer driver mutations and predictive markers for chemotherapy or programmed death-ligand 1 inhibition.Abstract:This study aimed to analyze the association between driver mutations and predictive markers for some anti-tumor agents in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A cohort of 785 Chinese patients with NSCLC who underwent resection from March 2016 to November 2017 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University was investigated. The specimens were subjected to hybridization capture and sequence of 8 important NSCLC-related driver genes. In addition, the slides were tested for PD-L1, excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1), thymidylate synthase (TS) and beta-tubulin III by immunohistochemical staining. A total of 498 (63.4%) patients had at least 1 driver gene alteration. Wild-type, EGFR rare mutation (mut), ALK fusion (fus), RAS mut, RET fus and MET mut had relatively higher proportions of lower ERCC1 expression. EGFR 19del, EGFR L858R, EGFR rare mut, ALK fus, HER2 mut, ROS1 fus and MET mut were more likely to have TS low expression. Wild-type, EGFR L858R, EGFR rare mut and BRAF mut were associated with lower beta-tubulin III expression. In addition, wild-type, RAS mut, ROS1 fus, BRAF and MET mut had higher proportion of PD-L1 high expression. As a pilot validation, 21 wild-type patients with advanced NSCLC showed better depth of response and response rate to taxanes compared with pemetrexed/gemcitabine (31.2%/60.0% vs 26.6%/45.5%). Our study may aid in selecting the optimal salvage regimen after targeted therapy failure, or the chemo-regimen where targeted therapy has not been a routine option. Further validation is warranted.|Cancer
ID:31037912|Title:[Galectin-3 Expression and Its Clinical Significance in Acute Myeloid Leukemia with Positive AML1/ETO Fusion Gene].Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mRNA expression of galectin-3 and its clinical significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients carrying AML1/ETOfusion gene. METHODS: RQ-PCR method was used to detect the expression of galectin-3 mRNA in bone marrow mononuclear cells of 53 AML patients with AML1/ETO+, ELISA was used to detect the expression of galectin-3 protein in peripheral blood, and the correlations of galectin-3 expression with clinical and laboratory features and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein levels of galectin-3 were significantly higher in newly diagnosed AML1/ETO+ AML patients compared with the control ( P<0.001). Galectin-3 mRNA and protein expressions were positively correlated (r=0.732, P<0.001). Galectin-3 protein was significantly decreased during the period of complete remission (CR)( P<0.001). The mRNA expression of galectin-3 was negatively correlated with the count of white blood cells ( P=0.014), and positively correlated with CD34 expression and additional cytogenetic aberrations (ACA) ( P=0.001, P=0.026). There was no significant difference in CR, partial remission (PR), induction death (early mortality) between galectin-3 high-expression group and low-expression group ( P>0.05), but there was significant difference in recurrence rate between the two groups ( P=0.029). The median overall survival (OS) rate and disease-free survival (DFS) rate were shortened in the high-expression group ( P=0.007, P=0.015) and the cumulative incidence of relapse was increased ( P=0.045), but there was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of CM(155mm]mortality ( P>0.05). Cox regression analysis suggested galectin-3 mRNA level an independent indicator of OS and DFS in AML1/ETO+ AML patients. CONCLUSION: Bone marrow galectin-3 mRNA level may be an important reference index for evaluating the prognosis and guiding the treatment of AML1/ETO+ AML patients.|Cancer
ID:31038558|Title:EVALUATING MMP-2 AND TGFss-RI EXPRESSION IN CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS OF PANCREATIC CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR CORRELATION WITH CLINICAL EVOLUTION.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Metastasis is common in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, and the presence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers in circulating tumor cells may suggest worse prognosis. AIM: To correlate the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood of patients with a locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic tumor and the protein expression involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CTCs with clinical characteristics, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). METHOD: This was a prospective study conducted using peripheral blood samples collected at three different times. CTCs were quantified by the ISET test and analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Proteins involved in EMT (vimentin, TGFss-RI and MMP2) were analyzed in all CTCs. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were included. Median CTCs detected were 22, 20 and 8 CTCs/8 ml blood at baseline, first and second follow-up, respectively. No statistically significant correlation was found in correlating the number of CTCs and the evaluated clinical characteristics, PFS, or OS. There was no difference in PFS and OS among the EMT markers in the groups with and without markers. CONCLUSION: CTC analysis was not relevant in this sample for comparing clinical findings, PFS and OS in patients with pancreatic cancer. However, marker analysis in CTCs could be useful for the MMP-2 and/or TGFss-RI expression, as observed by the separate PFS curve.|Cancer

ID:31043167|Title:SNW1 is a prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer.Abstract:BACKGROUND: SNW1 is a nuclear receptor co-activator involved in splicing and transcription control, including androgen receptor signaling. Overexpression of SNW1 has been linked to adverse prognosis in different cancer types, but studies on the role of SNW1 in prostate cancer are lacking. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed SNW1 expression in 10,310 prostate cancers in a tissue microarray (TMA) with attached clinical and molecular data. RESULTS: The comparison with normal prostate tissue revealed an up regulation of SNW1 in a subset of cancer samples. SNW1 staining was considered weak in 31.5%, moderate in 37.7% and strong in 14% of cancers. Strong SNW1 expression was markedly more frequent in prostate cancers harboring the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion (24%) than in ERG negative cancers (7%, p < 0.0001). Significant associations with Gleason grade, stage, nodal status and early biochemical recurrence were observed in the ERG negative and positive subset. Multivariable modeling revealed that the prognostic value of SNW1 up regulation was independent from the established preoperative histopathological and clinical parameters. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that SNW1 overexpression is an independent prognostic marker in prostate cancer with potential clinical utility.|Cancer
ID:31043608|Title:Capicua regulates neural stem cell proliferation and lineage specification through control of Ets factors.Abstract:Capicua (Cic) is a transcriptional repressor mutated in the brain cancer oligodendroglioma. Despite its cancer link, little is known of Cic's function in the brain. We show that nuclear Cic expression is strongest in astrocytes and neurons but weaker in stem cells and oligodendroglial lineage cells. Using a new conditional Cic knockout mouse, we demonstrate that forebrain-specific Cic deletion increases proliferation and self-renewal of neural stem cells. Furthermore, Cic loss biases neural stem cells toward glial lineage selection, expanding the pool of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). These proliferation and lineage effects are dependent on de-repression of Ets transcription factors. In patient-derived oligodendroglioma cells, CIC re-expression or ETV5 blockade decreases lineage bias, proliferation, self-renewal, and tumorigenicity. Our results identify Cic as an important regulator of cell fate in neurodevelopment and oligodendroglioma, and suggest that its loss contributes to oligodendroglioma by promoting proliferation and an OPC-like identity via Ets overactivity.|Cancer
ID:31046485|Title:Circulating cell-free nucleic acids as biomarkers in colorectal cancer screening and diagnosis - an update.Abstract:Introduction: Screening methods for one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancy, colorectal cancer (CRC), have limitations. Circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNA) hold clinical relevance as screening, prognostic and therapy monitoring markers. Area covered: In this review, we summarize potential CRC-specific cfNA biomarkers, the recently developed sample preparation techniques, their applications, and pitfalls. Expert opinion: Automated extraction of cfDNA is highly reproducible, however, cfDNA yield is less compared to manual isolation. Quantitative and highly sensitive detection techniques (e.g. digital PCR, NGS) can be applied to analyze genetic and epigenetic changes. Detection of DNA mutations or methylation in cfDNA and related altered levels of mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA may improve early cancer recognition, based on specific, CRC-related patterns. Detection of cfDNA mutations (e.g. TP53, KRAS, APC) has limited diagnostic sensitivity (40-60%), however, methylated DNA including SEPT9, SFRP1, SDC2 can be applied with higher sensitivity (up to 90%) for CRC. Circulating miRNAs (e.g. miR-21, miR-92, miR-141) provide comparably high sensitivity for CRC as the circulating tumor cell mRNA markers (e.g. EGFR, CK19, CK20, CEA). Automation of cfNA isolation coupled with quantitative analysis of CRC-related, highly sensitive biomarkers may enhance CRC screening and early detection in the future.|Cancer

ID:31048353|Title:Proposed diagnostic criteria for classical chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CMML variants and pre-CMML conditions.Abstract:Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myeloid neoplasm characterized by dysplasia, abnormal production and accumulation of monocytic cells and an elevated risk of transforming into acute leukemia. Over the past two decades, our knowledge about the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms in CMML has increased substantially. In parallel, better diagnostic criteria and therapeutic strategies have been developed. However, many questions remain regarding prognostication and optimal therapy. In addition, there is a need to define potential pre-phases of CMML and special CMML variants, and to separate these entities from each other and from conditions mimicking CMML. To address these unmet needs, an international consensus group met in a Working Conference in August 2018 and discussed open questions and issues around CMML, its variants, and pre-CMML conditions. The outcomes of this meeting are summarized herein and include diag nostic criteria and a proposed classification of pre-CMML conditions as well as refined minimal diagnostic criteria for classical CMML and special CMML variants, including oligomonocytic CMML and CMML associated with systemic mastocytosis. Moreover, we propose diagnostic standards and tools to distinguish between 'normal', pre-CMML and CMML entities. These criteria and standards should facilitate diagnostic and prognostic evaluations in daily practice and clinical studies in applied hematology.|Cancer
ID:31048490|Title:Genetic diversity of tumors with mismatch repair deficiency influences anti-PD-1 immunotherapy response.Abstract:Tumors with mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-d) are characterized by sequence alterations in microsatellites and can accumulate thousands of mutations. This high mutational burden renders tumors immunogenic and sensitive to programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors. Yet, despite their tumor immunogenicity, patients with MMR-deficient tumors experience highly variable responses, and roughly half are refractory to treatment. We present experimental and clinical evidence showing that the degree of microsatellite instability (MSI) and resultant mutational load, in part, underlies the variable response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in MMR-d human and mouse tumors. The extent of response is particularly associated with the accumulation of insertion-deletion (indel) mutational load. This study provides a rationale for the genome-wide characterization of MSI intensity and mutational load to better profile responses to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy across MMR-deficient human cancers.|Cancer
ID:31049933|Title:Advanced-stage mycosis fungoides: role of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, nuclear factor-kappaB and nuclear factor of activated T cells pathways.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The malignant mechanisms that control the development of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) are beginning to be identified. Recent evidence suggests that disturbances in specific intracellular signalling pathways, such as RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase, T-cell receptor (TCR)-phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1)-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), may play an essential role in the pathogenesis of CTCL. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mechanisms controlling disease development and progression in mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common form of CTCL. METHODS: We collected 100 samples that were submitted for diagnosis of, or a second opinion regarding, MF between 2001 and 2018, 80% of which were in the early clinical stages of the disease. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were used for histological review and to measure the expression by immunohistochemistry of surrogate markers of activation of the TCR-PLCG1-NFAT, JAK-STAT and NF-kappaB pathways. Folliculotropism and large-cell transformation were also examined. RESULTS: NFAT and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) markers showed a comparable activation status in early and advanced stages, while STAT3 activation was more frequent in advanced stages and was associated with large-cell transformation. Consistently with this observation, STAT3 activation occurred in parallel with MF progression in two initially MF-negative cases. A significant association of NFAT with NF-kappaB markers was also found, reflecting a common mechanism of activation in the two pathways. Genomic studies identified nine mutations in seven genes known to play a potential role in tumorigenesis in T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma, including PLCG1, JAK3 and STAT3, which underlies the activation of these key cell-survival pathways. A higher mutational allele frequency was detected in advanced stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that STAT3 is activated in advanced cases and is associated with large-cell transformation, while the activation of NFAT and NF-kappaB is maintained throughout the disease. These findings could have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. What's already known about this topic? Mycosis fungoides is characterized by a clonal expansion of T cells in the skin. The mechanisms controlling disease development and progression are not fully understood. What does this study add? An association of the nuclear factor of activated T cells and nuclear factor kappa B pathways was found, which could reflect a common mechanism of activation. These pathways were activated in early and advanced stages at the same level. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation was associated with large-cell transformation and was more frequent in advanced stages. A genomic analysis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-associated genes was performed. Nine mutations were detected. What is the translational message? These results could have important implications for the treatment of MF in the near future.|Cancer
ID:31050834|Title:Six1 regulates leukemia stem cell maintenance in acute myeloid leukemia.Abstract:Molecular genetic changes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) play crucial roles in leukemogenesis, including recurrent chromosome translocations, epigenetic/spliceosome mutations and transcription factor aberrations. Six1, a transcription factor of the Sine oculis homeobox (Six) family, has been shown to transform normal hematopoietic progenitors into leukemia in cooperation with Eya. However, the specific role and the underlying mechanism of Six1 in leukemia maintenance remain unexplored. Here, we showed increased expression of SIX1 in AML patients and murine leukemia stem cells (c-Kit+ cells, LSCs). Importantly, we also observed that a higher level of Six1 in human patients predicts a worse prognosis. Notably, knockdown of Six1 significantly prolonged the survival of MLL-AF9-induced AML mice with reduced peripheral infiltration and tumor burden. AML cells from Six1-knockdown (KD) mice displayed a significantly decreased number and function of LSC, as assessed by the immunophenotype, colony-forming ability and limiting dilution assay. Further analysis revealed the augmented apoptosis of LSC and decreased expression of glycolytic genes in Six1 KD mice. Overall, our data showed that Six1 is essential for the progression of MLL-AF9-induced AML via maintaining the pool of LSC.|Cancer
ID:31053248|Title:Receptor radionuclide targeting for neuroendocrine tumors (NET) diagnostic and therapy.Abstract:Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) represent a heterogeneous group of tumors originating from cells of neuroendocrine origin, which express somatostatin receptors (SSTR). This property allowed the successful development of radionuclides for diagnostic and peptide radionuclide radiation therapy (PRRT). This is the paradigm for the theragnostic concept in NET personalized medicine. The only phase III study to date (NETTER-1) clearly demonstrated the ability of 177Lutetium-based PRRT to improve progression-free survival in advanced intestinal NETs. In clinical practice, the indications are limited to G1-G2 well-differentiated NETs with high expression of SSTR. NETs with a low tumor burden and slow progression are probably the optimal indication. This treatment is now available in France. However, its precise position in the treatment algorithm remains to be explored. We provide an overview of receptor radionuclide utilization and mechanism in diagnostic and pretherapeutic imaging and we focus on PRRT for endocrine tumors.|Cancer
ID:31054046|Title:Osteosarcoma and second malignant neoplasms: a case series.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The overall survival of patients with localised osteosarcoma has dramatically improved with the introduction of multidrug chemotherapeutic regimens into the treatment paradigm. However, despite optimal treatment, all-cause mortality remains higher among osteosarcoma survivors than in the general population. The development of second malignant neoplasms contributes to this higher mortality rate. CASE SERIES: We present three cases of patients definitively treated for osteosarcoma who subsequently developed a second malignant neoplasm. The first case describes a 17-year-old female with osteosarcoma of her right femur treated with surgical resection and perioperative chemotherapy. Ten years later, she was diagnosed with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Genetic testing identified a germline TP53 mutation, confirming the presence of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The second case details an 18-year-old male with osteosarcoma of his right humerus treated with definitive resection and perioperative chemotherapy. He was diagnosed with appendiceal adenocarcinoma after presenting with acute abdominal pain 17 years later. The third case reviewed is of a 36-year-old male with osteosarcoma of his right femur treated with definitive resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. A diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma was made 7 years later following surveillance imaging. DISCUSSION: The risk of second malignant neoplasms in osteosarcoma may relate to previous oncological treatment, an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome or a spontaneous new neoplasm. Although screening for a second malignancy is not routinely recommended for osteosarcoma survivors, a high degree of clinical suspicion should be maintained during surveillance.|Cancer
ID:31055803|Title:[Analysis of age-specific cytogenetic changes among 515 patients withacute myeloid leukemia].Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To characterize cytogenetic changes and prognosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from different age groups. METHODS: The karyotypes of 515 AML patients were analyzed by using short-term culture of bone marrow cells and R-banding technique. Combined with FAB typing and genetic testing, cytogenetic changes and prognosis of different age groups were analyzed. RESULTS: The abnormal cloning rate was 54.6% among the 515 patients. The abnormal cloning rate and adverse risk karyotype proportion of those with myeloproliferative syndromes (MDS) and secondary AML were higher than those with de novo AML (P = 0.027; P<0.01). A significant difference was found in the number of structural abnormalities and proportion of favorable risk karyotypes among different age groups (P = 0.026; P = 0.004). And there was also a significant difference in the abnormal cloning rate between different FAB types (P<0.01). In those with non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the expression level of WT1 gene seemed to affect the prognosis. The survival rate of patients with karyotypes of adverse risk was lower than those with karyotypes of favorable risk (P = 0.015). The survival rate of the >=60-year-old group was lower than the <=30-year-old and 31 to 59-year-old groups (P<0.01, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The karyotypes of AML patients have different age distribution characteristics. The survival rate of >=60-years-old group and karyotype of poor prognosis is low. Patients with MDS with secondary AML have a poor prognosis.|Cancer
ID:31055804|Title:[Characterizing the molecular cytogenetics in acute monocytic leukemia].Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To characterize the molecular genetics of 81 patients with acute monocytic leukemia (AML). METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was employed to detect MLL gene rearrangements. Combined mutations of 17 genes were detected by DNA-based PCR and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Sixty seven patients were found to harbor at least one mutation. The most commonly mutated gene was NPM1 (n=18), which was followed by FLT3-ITD (n=16), NRAS (n=16), DNMT3A (n=15), TET2 (n=12), RUNX1 (n=11) and KRAS (n=9). Based on the functions of mutated genes, the most frequently involved genes were those involved in DNA methylation (38.27%), tyrosine kinase receptor signaling (32.1%), transcription regulation (28.4%), and RAS pathway (24.7%). Single gene mutation predominated in patient with cytogenetic abnormalities, while coexistence of 2 mutations have predominated in patient with normal cytogenetic findings. Stratified by cytogenetic findings, patients with single gene mutations (intermediate-risk group) had significantly higher complete remission (CR) rates than those with >=2 gene mutations (unfavorable-risk group) (91.7% vs. 57.6% , 87.5% vs. 25.0%, P =0.0319, 0.0117, respectively). CONCLUSION: Over 80% of AML patients were found to harbor at least one mutation. Their clinical phenotype and prognosis may be impacted by the synergy of MLL gene rearrangement and multiple mutations. For patients under the same risk stratification, the number of mutations is reversely correlated with the CR rate.|Cancer
ID:31055940|Title:A Pilot Low-Inflammatory Dietary Intervention to Reduce Inflammation and Improve Quality of Life in Patients With Familial Adenomatous Polyposis: Protocol Description and Preliminary Results.Abstract:Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) depend on a lifelong endoscopic surveillance programme and prophylactic surgery, and usually suffer nutritional problems. Intestinal inflammation has been linked to both FAP and colorectal cancer. Epidemiological studies show a relationship between diet and inflammation. Preventive dietary recommendations for FAP patients are so far lacking. We have designed a nonrandomized prospective pilot study on FAP patients to assess whether a low-inflammatory diet based on the Mediterranean diet principles and recipes, by interacting with the microbiota, reduces gastrointestinal markers of inflammation and improves quality of life. This report describes the scientific protocol of the study and reports the participants' adherence to the proposed dietary recommendations. Thirty-four FAP patients older than 18 years, bearing the APC pathogenic variant, who underwent prophylactic total colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis were eligible into the study. During the 3-month dietary intervention, they reported improvements in their consumption of Mediterranean foods (vegetables, fruits, fish, and legumes), and a reduction in pro-inflammatory foods (red/processed meat and sweets); this led to a significant increase in their adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The improvement was accompanied by a decrease in the number of diarrhoeal discharges. These preliminary results are encouraging with regard to feasibility, dietary outcome measures, and safety.|Cancer
ID:31062729|Title:FISH and HER2/neu equivocal immunohistochemistry in breast carcinoma.Abstract:AIM: The aim of this study was to validate the role of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in investigating HER2/neu gene amplification (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) in patients with HER2/neu equivocal breast cancer diagnosed on immunohistochemistry (IHC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted from January 2013 to October 2017. A total of 134 patients diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma and HER2/neu equivocal status on IHC were analyzed. Also, the cases for the years 2016 and 2017 formed a subgroup that was analyzed further to study the impact of pre-analytical factors on IHC and FISH results. RESULTS: A total of 134 women with HER2/neu IHC equivocal breast cancer were included in the study with a median age of 50 years (range 25-81). HER2/neu amplification by FISH was noted in 72 (54%) cases, whereas it was non-amplified in 52 (39%) cases. Ten cases were reported as equivocal even on FISH (ASCO/CAP 2013 guidelines). Polysomy 17 was noted in 55 cases (41%), of which 26 patients were<=50 years and 29 patients were >50 years of age. Twenty (36%) of these 55 cases showed HER2/neu amplification, whereas 26 (48%) cases were non-amplified and 9 (16%) cases were reported as equivocal on FISH. Also, more than half of the polysomy cases were hormone receptor negative. CONCLUSION: IHC is a good screening tool for negative and positive results. Any patient targeted for trastuzumab therapy should undergo confirmation of HER2/neu equivocal status by FISH analysis. We also suggest that if a non-classical FISH pattern is seen, the test should be repeated with a non-centromeric chromosome 17 reference locus probe for better treatment planning.|Cancer
ID:31065274|Title:A Potential Antitumor Effect of Dendritic Cells Fused with Cancer Stem Cells in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Abstract:HCC stem cells were reported as posttreatment residual tumor cells that play a pivotal role in tumor relapse. Fusing dendritic cells (DCs) with tumor cells represents an ideal approach to effectively activate the antitumor immunity in vivo. DC/HCC stem cell vaccine provides a potential strategy to generate polyclonal immune response to multiple tumor stem cell antigens including those yet to be unidentified. To assess the potential capacity of DC/HCC stem cell vaccines against HCC, CD90+HepG2 cells were sorted from the HCC cell line HepG2. DC and CD90+HepG2 and DC and HepG2 fused cells were induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG). The influence of fusion cells on proliferation and immunological function transformation of lymphocytes was assessed by FCM and ELISA assay, respectively. The cytotoxicity assay of specific fusion cell-induced CTLs against HepG2 was conducted by CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit in vitro. At last, the prevention of HCC formation in vivo was described in a mouse model. The results of FCM analysis showed that the proportion of CD90+HepG2 cells in the spheral CD90+HepG2 enriched by suspension sphere culture was ranging from 98.7% to 99.5%, and 57.1% CD90+HepG2/DC fused cells were successfully constructed. The fusion cells expressed a higher level of costimulatory molecules CD80, CD83, CD86, and MHC-I and MHC-II molecules HLA-ABC and HLA-DR than did immature DCs (P < 0.05). And the functional analysis of fusion cell-induced CTLs also illustrated that CD90+HepG2/DC fusion cells showed a greater capacity to activate proliferation of lymphocytes in vitro (P < 0.05). The CD90+HepG2/DC-activated CTLs had a specific killing ability against CD90+HepG2 cells in vivo. These results suggested that CD90+HepG2/DC fusion cells could efficiently stimulate T lymphocytes to generate specific CTLs targeting CD90+HepG2 cells. It might be a promising strategy of immunotherapy for HCC.|Cancer
ID:31068555|Title:[Heterogeneity of genomic alterations and clinical aspects in peripheral T-cell lymphoma: future perspectives].Abstract:Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoid malignancies. Several recent comprehensive genomic studies characterize the genomic alterations of each PTCL type and reveal the complexity and heterogeneity. The updated World Health Organization classification has precisely distinguished "lymphoma" from "lymphoproliferative disorder" and has included a new entity based on the tumor phenotypes. Although establishing the classifications based on genomic alterations has been difficult because of heterogeneity, the genomic alterations may support the diagnosis. Establishing genomic alterations that act as predictive markers for clinical courses and/or therapeutic targets is needed in future studies using genomic alteration information. Since patients with PTCL generally have poor prognosis, establishing the target and standard therapies is one of the major issues to be addressed. In addition to clinicopathological and genomic analyses, patient-derived xenograft models can provide these therapeutic strategies. Integration of analyzed data is considered to promote future PTCL studies, leading to improved PTCL prognosis.|Cancer
ID:31069152|Title:APC germline hepatoblastomas demonstrate cisplatin-induced intratumor tertiary lymphoid structures.Abstract:Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common liver cancer in children. We aimed to characterize HB related to APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) germline mutation (APC-HB). This French multicentric retrospective study included 12 APC-HB patients under 5 at diagnosis. Clinical features of APC-HB were compared to the French SIOPEL2-3 cohort of HB patients. Molecular and histopathological analyses of APC-HB were compared to 15 consecutive sporadic HB treated at Bicetre hospital from 2013 to 2015 (non-APC-HB). APC-HB patients have a peculiar spectrum of germline APC mutations, with no events in the main hotspot of classical APC mutations at codon 1309 (P < .05). Compared to sporadic HB, they have similar clinical features including good prognosis since all patients are alive in complete remission at last follow-up. APC-HB are mostly well-limited tumors with fetal predominance and few mesenchymal components. All APC-HB have an activated Wnt/beta-catenin pathway without CTNNB1 mutation, confirming that germline APC and somatic CTNNB1 mutations are mutually exclusive (P < .001). Pathological reviewing identified massive intratumor tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) containing both lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells in all 11 APC-HB cases who received cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy but not in five pre-chemotherapy samples (four paired biopsies and one patient resected without chemotherapy), indicating that these TLS are induced by chemotherapy (P < .001). Conclusion: APC-HB show a good prognosis, they are all infiltrated by cisplatin-induced TLS, a feature only retrieved in a minority of non-APC-HB. This suggests that APC inactivation can synergize with cisplatin to induce an immunogenic cell death that initiates an anti-tumor immune response.|Cancer
ID:31069978|Title:Inherited thrombocytopenia and platelet disorders with germline predisposition to myeloid neoplasia.Abstract:Advances in molecular genetic sequencing techniques have contributed to the elucidation of previously unknown germline mutations responsible for inherited thrombocytopenia (IT). Regardless of age of presentation and severity of symptoms related to thrombocytopenia and/or platelet dysfunction, a subset of patients with IT are at increased risk of developing myeloid neoplasms during their life time, particularly those with germline autosomal dominant mutations in RUNX1, ANKRD26, and ETV6. Patients may present with isolated thrombocytopenia and megakaryocytic dysmorphia or atypia on baseline bone marrow evaluation, without constituting myelodysplasia (MDS). Bone marrow features may overlap with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or sporadic MDS leading to misdiagnosis. Progression to myelodysplastic syndrome/ acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) may be accompanied by progressive bi- or pancytopenia, multilineage dysplasia, increased blasts, cytogenetic abnormalities, acquisition of bi-allelic mutations in the underlying gene with germline mutation, or additional somatic mutations in genes associated with myeloid malignancy. A subset of patients may present with MDS/AML at a young age, underscoring the growing concern for evaluating young patients with MDS/AML for germline mutations predisposing to myeloid neoplasm. Early recognition of germline mutation and predisposition to myeloid malignancy permits appropriate treatment, adequate monitoring for disease progression, proper donor selection for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as well as genetic counseling of the affected patients and their family members. Herein, we describe the clinical and diagnostic features of IT with germline mutations predisposing to myeloid neoplasms focusing on mutations involving RUNX1, ANKRD26, and ETV6.|Cancer
ID:31074748|Title:Controlling trapping states on selective theranostic core@shell (NaYF4:Yb,Tm@TiO2-ZrO2) nanocomplexes for enhanced NIR-activated photodynamic therapy against breast cancer cells.Abstract:Photodynamic and immune therapies are innovative medical strategies against cancer, and their integration with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) can improve the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. The UCNPs convert the deep penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light into higher energy emissions, allowing the imaging and detection of malignant cells and the simultaneous energy transfer for activation of the photosensitizers. In this work, the UCNPs were coated with a photocatalytic TiO2/ZrO2 shell and an increase of oxygen defects (VO) was observed as a result of the partial substitution of Ti4+ by Zr4+ ions in the crystalline lattice of TiO2. Such defects act as trapping states improving charge separation and then reducing the recombination rate of the electron-hole pairs (e-/h+) generated upon resonant energy transfer from the donor (UCNPs) to acceptors (shell). The overall results are the enhancement of both ROS production and the emission band centered at 801 nm which is useful for tracking cells at the deep tissue level. However, an excess of those defects produces deleterious effects on both processes as a result of charge migration. The specificity against HER2 positive breast cancer was provided by bioconjugation with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. After administration of the synthesized NaYF4:Yb,Tm@TiO2/ZrO2-trastuzumab theranostic nanocomplex doped with an optimal ZrO2 molar concentration (25%) and subsequent exposure to 975 nm light (0.71 W cm-2) during 5 minutes, HER2-positive SKBr3 breast cancer cells were suppressed with 88% drop of the cell viability, 28% higher than UCNPs decorated with a pure TiO2 shell.|Cancer
ID:31076661|Title:Going to extremes: determinants of extraordinary response and survival in patients with cancer.Abstract:Research into factors affecting treatment response or survival in patients with cancer frequently involves cohorts that span the most common range of clinical outcomes, as such patients are most readily available for study. However, attention has turned to highly unusual patients who have exceptionally favourable or atypically poor responses to treatment and/or overall survival, with the expectation that patients at the extremes may provide insights that could ultimately improve the outcome of individuals with more typical disease trajectories. While clinicians can often recount surprising patients whose clinical journey was very unusual, given known clinical characteristics and prognostic indicators, there is a lack of consensus among researchers on how best to define exceptional patients, and little has been proposed for the optimal design of studies to identify factors that dictate unusual outcome. In this Opinion article, we review different approaches to identifying exceptional patients with cancer and possible study designs to investigate extraordinary clinical outcomes. We discuss pitfalls with finding these rare patients, including challenges associated with accrual of patients across different treatment centres and time periods. We describe recent molecular and immunological factors that have been identified as contributing to unusual patient outcome and make recommendations for future studies on these intriguing patients.|Cancer
ID:31077215|Title:Low expression of ACLY associates with favorable prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Aberrant metabolism is a hallmark of cancer cells. Recently, ATP citrate-lyase (ACLY) expression was demonstrated as an independent predictor of clinical outcome in solid tumors. However, no systematic study was conducted to explore the prognostic impact of ACLY on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: To assess the prognostic value of ACLY transcript, we conducted a study with a discovery and validation design. We measured ACLY transcript by real-time quantitative PCR in 274 AML patients, and validated the prognostic value in the two independent cohorts using published data. Meta-analysis of gene-expression profile and inhibition ACLY expression in leukemia cell lines were conducted to help us understand the biological insight of low ACLY expression. RESULTS: Low ACLY expression is less common amongst AMLs with DNMT3A mutations, but coexisted in double allele CEBPA mutations. Moreover, low ACLY expression is associated with favorable overall survival in AML patients and is involved in multiple pathways. These results are also validated in two independent cohorts of AML patients. Moreover, ACLY silencing induces proliferation arrest in THP-1 and MOLM-13 leukemia cell lines. CONCLUSION: We found low ACLY expression is associated with favorable overall survival in AML patients.|Cancer
ID:31077683|Title:Classification of acute myeloid leukemia by the revised fourth edition World Health Organization criteria: a retrospective single-institution study with appraisal of the new entities of acute myeloid leukemia with gene mutations in NPM1 and biallelic CEBPA.Abstract:The 2016/2017 World Health Organization (WHO2016/2017) classification for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) includes new entities with gene mutations in NPM1 (AML-NPM1mut) and biallelic CEBPA (AML-biCEBPAmut). To retrospectively identify and study these new molecularly defined WHO2016/2017entities, we reviewed clinicopathologic data and pretherapy archived pathologic materials at diagnosis for 143 consecutive AML cases (55.2% male, median age 62 [range 18-89] years) and classified all cases by the 2008 WHO (WHO2008) and revised WHO2016/2017 criteria. By WHO2008, cases included 21 (15%) with recurrent genetic abnormalities (52.3% male, median age 54 [range 18-82] years), 54 (38%) with myelodysplasia-related changes (57.4% male, median age 65 [range 32-84] years), 3 (2%) therapy related (100% male, median age 66 [range 32-84] years), and 65 (45%) not otherwise specified (52.3% male, median age 61 [range 19-89] years). Twenty-two (15.4%) cases (21 AML, not otherwise specified; 1 AML with myelodysplasia-related changes by WHO2008) reclassified by WHO2016/2017 as AML-NPM1mut showed female predominance (54.5%), and median (range) values were as follows: age 60.5 (23-84) years, hemoglobin 8.6 (5.6-12.9) g/dL, total leucocytes 30.1 (2.58-241.84) x 109/L, monocytes 1.65 (0-49.34) x 109/L, neutrophils 1.96 (0-29.79) x 109/L, platelets 55 (11-320) x 109/L, blasts (peripheral blood 41% [2%-98%], bone marrow 66% [17%-97%]), with myeloblastsCD34neg (17 [77%]/21), cytogeneticsnormal (20 [91%]/22), FLT3-ITDpos (9 [41%]/22), FLT3-ITDnegFLT3-TKDpos (5 [23%]/22), FLT3-ITDnegFLT3-TKDneg (8 [36%]/22), and extramedullary involvement (6 [27%]/22), including 1 novel cutaneous presentation. Notably, presenting features among AML-NPM1mut included those of anemia (22 [100%]) and thrombocytopenia (20 [91%]/22). This is also the first report of 4 [18%]/22 AML-NPM1mut (including 3 [75%]/4 nonsmokers) with a family history of leukemia and one 74-year-old with familial AML-biCEBPAmut. This study validates the application of the WHO2016/2017 classification criteria by retrospectively identifying AML-NPM1mut and AML-biCEBPAmut cases using single-gene molecular analyses. Additional studies are needed to characterize the complete spectrum of WHO2016/2017-defined AML-biCEBPAmut and for familial AML including AML-NPM1mut.|Cancer
ID:31083180|Title:Concurrent lymphoma and hemophilia B in a pediatric patient: A case report.Abstract:INTRODUCTION: Lymphoma is the third most common cancer among children in the United States and Europe. Hemophilia is a congenital bleeding disorder characterized by deficiency of coagulation factor VIII or IX. Hemophilia B is a consequence of factor IX deficiency and has an incidence of 1 in 20,000 male births. A concurrence of these 2 uncommon diseases is rare except in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We report a case of a patient with both Burkitt lymphoma and hemophilia B; this is only such report in China since 1987. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 3-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital because of melena and jaundice for several days. His older brother had died due to hemophilia B and ventricular septal defect. The patient had not experienced any previous episodes of severe bleeding. Gradual abdominal distention was observed after admission; the patient's superficial lymph nodes were not enlarged. Results of blood routine and bone marrow examinations showed no abnormalities. He was diagnosed with sclerosing cholangitis, abdominal infection, and hepatitis. However, after treatment of reducing enzyme activity and eliminating jaundice, the patient's condition deteriorated. Hydrops abdominis was detected on abdominal ultrasonography. Tumor cells were found by pathological examination of peritoneal effusion. Both a c-myc gene translocation and a c-myc-IgH gene fusion were detected. DIAGNOSIS: Burkitt lymphoma and hemophilia B. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was transferred to the Pediatric Hematology Department of our hospital and treated with a modified B-NHL-BFM-95 protocol. During chemotherapy, platelet changes were monitored regularly and blood products were infused timely. OUTCOMES: The patient died of infection and bleeding after chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Concurrent hemophilia and lymphoma are rare, especially in children. When encountering a patient with unexplained obstructive jaundice and massive ascites, the possibility of a tumor should be considered. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment of such tumor may improve prognosis.|Cancer
ID:31083279|Title:Oncogenic Effect of the Novel Fusion Gene VAPA-Rab31 in Lung Adenocarcinoma.Abstract:Fusion genes have been identified as oncogenes in several solid tumors including lung, colorectal, and stomach cancers. Here, we characterized the fusion gene, VAPA-Rab31, discovered from RNA-sequencing data of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who did not harbor activating mutations in EGFR, KRAS and ALK. This fusion gene encodes a protein comprising the N-terminal region of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein A (VAPA) fused to the C-terminal region of Ras-related protein 31 (Rab31). Exogenous expression of VAPA-Rab31 in immortalized normal bronchial epithelial cells demonstrated the potential transforming effects of this fusion gene, including increased colony formation and cell proliferation in vitro. Also, enhanced tumorigenicity upon VAPA-Rab31 was confirmed in vivo using a mouse xenograft model. Metastatic tumors were also detected in the liver and lungs of xenografted mice. Overexpression of VAPA-Rab31 upregulated anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and phosphorylated CREB both in cells and xenograft tumors. Reduced apoptosis and increased phosphorylation of CREB and Erk were observed in VAPA-Rab31-overexpressing cells after bortezomib treatment. Elevated Bcl-2 level via activated CREB contributed to the resistance to the bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest the oncogenic function of the novel fusion gene VAPA-Rab31 via upregulated Bcl-2 and activated CREB in lung cancer.|Cancer
ID:31086113|Title:A Comparison of DNA Mutation and Copy Number Profiles of Primary Breast Cancers and Paired Brain Metastases for Identifying Clinically Relevant Genetic Alterations in Brain Metastases.Abstract:Improving the systemic treatment of brain metastases (BM) in primary breast cancer (PBC) is impaired by the lack of genomic characterization of BM. To estimate the concordance of DNA copy-number-alterations (CNAs), mutations, and actionable genetic alterations (AGAs) between paired samples, we performed whole-genome array-comparative-genomic-hybridization, and targeted-next-generation-sequencing on 14 clinical PBC-BM pairs. We found more CNAs, more mutations, and higher tumor mutational burden, and more AGAs in BM than in PBC; 92% of the pairs harbored at least one AGA in the BM not observed in the paired PBC. This concerned various therapeutic classes, including tyrosine-kinase-receptor-inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/ mammalian Target of Rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/MTOR)-inhibitors, poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)-inhibitors, or cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-inhibitors. With regards to the PARP-inhibitors, the homologous recombination defect score was positive in 79% of BM, compared to 43% of PBC, discordant in 7 out of 14 pairs, and positive in the BM in 5 out of 14 cases. CDK-inhibitors were associated with the largest percentage of discordant AGA appearing in the BM. When considering the AGA with the highest clinical-evidence level, for each sample, 50% of the pairs harbored an AGA in the BM not detected or not retained from the analysis of the paired PBC. Thus, the profiling of BM provided a more reliable opportunity, than that of PBC, for diagnostic decision-making based on genomic analysis. Patients with BM deserve an investigation of several targeted therapies.|Cancer
ID:31092450|Title:Role of Amino Acid Transporter Expression as a Prognostic Marker in Patients With Surgically Resected Colorectal Cancer.Abstract:BACKGROUND/AIM: L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is highly expressed in various human cancers. However, the clinicopathological significance of LAT1 and 4F2 cell surface antigen (4F2hc) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the prognostic significance of LAT1 expression in CRC patients who underwent surgical resection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from one hundred and forty-seven patients were examined by immunohistochemistry. The expression of LAT1 and 4F2hc, and the Ki-67 labeling index were assessed using resected tumor specimens. RESULTS: The positive expression of LAT1 and 4F2c was 80% (118/147) and 58% (86/147) (p<0.01), respectively. The expression of LAT1 was identified as an independent significant marker linked to worse prognosis in patients with CRC, and was correlated with tumor cell proliferation, tumor aggressiveness, and metastasis. Moreover, LAT1 was closely associated with the expression of 4F2hc and phosphorylation of the mTOR pathway. CONCLUSION: LAT1 is a significant molecular marker used to predict prognosis after surgical resection of CRC patients.|Cancer
ID:31094133|Title:Epicardial Fat Mimicking Pericardial Tumours: Case Series And Review Of Literature.Abstract:Advances in imaging modalities have improved diagnosis of diseases in patients allowing physicians to make earlier and accurate diagnosis with resultant improved overall outcome for patients. Sometimes, however this comes at a cost of over estimation of normal variants leading to further unnecessary investigations or in extreme cases interventions. In this article, we demonstrate three cases where epicardial fat is misdiagnosed as pericardial masses which are an example of misinterpretation of normal findings. Correct identification of pericardial fat on transthoracic echocardiograms is important in reducing misdiagnosis and also anxiety for both physicians and patients. Knowledge about normal variants not only improves patients care but also reduce unnecessary investigations that are subsequently ordered for clarification.|Cancer

Detailed examination of placenta including MYCN amplification and segmental chromosomal aberrations should be performed in all suspected cases, as it is noninvasive and readily available. Maternal dissemination has not been reported. In this manuscript, we describe an infant with placental diagnosis of MYCN nonamplified congenital neuroblastoma. This is the first report of a recurrence of congenital 4S neuroblastoma following resolution in which MYCN amplification is only detected in the recurrence. Germline sequencing using a large comprehensive cancer panel did not reveal variants in candidate cancer predisposition genes.|Cancer
ID:31095042|Title:The programmed cell death protein-1/programmed cell death ligand 1 expression, CD3+ T cell infiltration, NY-ESO-1 expression, and microsatellite instability phenotype in primary cutaneous melanoma and mucosal melanoma and their clinical significance and prognostic value: a study of 89 consecutive cases.Abstract:We evaluated the expression of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and NY-ESO-1 antigen; the infiltration of CD3+ T cells; and the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype, as well as the relationship of each factor to survival in malignant melanoma patients. Malignant melanoma samples from 89 patients were stained by immunohistochemistry to evaluate PD-1, PD-L1, CD3+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), NY-ESO-1, and MSI. PD-1 and PD-L1 were expressed in 19.1 and 32.6% of the 89 samples, respectively. There was a significant correlation between PD-1 and PD-L1 expression (r = 0.207, P = 0.046). High infiltration of CD3+ T cells was observed in 41.6% of the samples, and increased cell infiltration was associated with increased PD-1 expression (P = 0.001). NY-ESO-1 antigen was detected in 13.5% of all samples, and the expression of NY-ESO-1 was positively correlated with the expression of PD-1 (P < 0.001). In our research, MSI was detected in 18 samples (20.2%). Survival analysis showed that a high infiltration of CD3+ T cells was related to longer progression-free survival (PFS) [24.0 months, 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.4-40.6 vs. 11.0 months, 95% CI: 7.1-12.9, P = 0.031], similarly, the median overall survival (OS) of the CD3+ T cell high-infiltration patients was also longer (53.0 vs. 38.0 months), but with no statistical significance (P = 0.200). The results for the immune markers mentioned above provide a theoretical basis for the prognosis and immunotherapy selection of malignant melanoma patients.|Cancer
ID:31097693|Title:MEK inhibitors activate Wnt signalling and induce stem cell plasticity in colorectal cancer.Abstract:In colorectal cancer (CRC), aberrant Wnt signalling is essential for tumorigenesis and maintenance of cancer stem cells. However, how other oncogenic pathways converge on Wnt signalling to modulate stem cell homeostasis in CRC currently remains poorly understood. Using large-scale compound screens in CRC, we identify MEK1/2 inhibitors as potent activators of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. Targeting MEK increases Wnt activity in different CRC cell lines and murine intestine in vivo. Truncating mutations of APC generated by CRISPR/Cas9 strongly synergize with MEK inhibitors in enhancing Wnt responses in isogenic CRC models. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that MEK inhibition induces a rapid downregulation of AXIN1. Using patient-derived CRC organoids, we show that MEK inhibition leads to increased Wnt activity, elevated LGR5 levels and enrichment of gene signatures associated with stemness and cancer relapse. Our study demonstrates that clinically used MEK inhibitors inadvertently induce stem cell plasticity, revealing an unknown side effect of RAS pathway inhibition.|Cancer
ID:31097696|Title:Functional linkage of gene fusions to cancer cell fitness assessed by pharmacological and CRISPR-Cas9 screening.Abstract:Many gene fusions are reported in tumours and for most their role remains unknown. As fusions are used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, and are targets for treatment, it is crucial to assess their function in cancer. To systematically investigate the role of fusions in tumour cell fitness, we utilized RNA-sequencing data from 1011 human cancer cell lines to functionally link 8354 fusion events with genomic data, sensitivity to >350 anti-cancer drugs and CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-fitness effects. Established clinically-relevant fusions were identified. Overall, detection of functional fusions was rare, including those involving cancer driver genes, suggesting that many fusions are dispensable for tumour fitness. Therapeutically actionable fusions involving RAF1, BRD4 and ROS1 were verified in new histologies. In addition, recurrent YAP1-MAML2 fusions were identified as activators of Hippo-pathway signaling in multiple cancer types. Our approach discriminates functional fusions, identifying new drivers of carcinogenesis and fusions that could have clinical implications.|Cancer
ID:31100224|Title:Features and Prognostic Significance of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.Abstract:CONTEXT: Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) is an intraglandular/ductal neoplastic growth of glandular epithelial cells characterized by marked abnormality of the glandular architecture and/or cytological atypia that exceeds what is typically seen in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HPGIN). It has been shown that IDC-P is a strong independent indicator of poor prognosis for prostate carcinoma (PCa). OBJECTIVE: To review the pathological and genetic features, diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis, and clinical significance of IDC-P. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed was searched using keywords including prostate carcinoma, intraductal carcinoma, IDC, histology, diagnostic criteria, and prognosis. The references in relevant articles were also reviewed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: IDC-P is a distinct entity with characteristic morphological and genetic features. It is strongly associated with aggressive PCa with high Gleason score/grade groups and large tumor volume, and portends unfavorable clinical outcomes. Morphological diagnostic criteria have been established to distinguish it from other lesions with similar histological features. IDC-P is an uncommon finding in prostate biopsies, and is even rarer as an isolated finding without concomitant PCa. However, patients with isolated IDC-P in biopsy specimens are recommended to have either definitive treatment or immediate repeat biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: It is critical to recognize and report IDC-P, especially in prostate biopsies, where the clinical impact of such a diagnosis is greatest. PATIENT SUMMARY: Intraductal carcinoma is a unique form of aggressive prostate cancer. In this report, we review its pathological and genetic features and poor prognostic significance. It is critical for pathologists to recognize and report this lesion in prostate specimens, especially in prostate biopsies for patient management.|Cancer
ID:31100235|Title:Not All Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsies Are Equal: The Impact of the Type of Approach and Operator Expertise on the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The extensive use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has led to an even more widespread use of different targeted biopsy techniques and approaches. The best way of performing targeted biopsies and the effect of operator expertise have still to be defined. OBJECTIVE: To compare the rate of detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) of different mpMRI targeted approaches and to assess the role of operator expertise in the detection of csPCa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 244 consecutive patients who underwent both 12-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy and mpMRI targeted biopsy with either a cognitive biopsy (CB) or fusion biopsy (FB) approach during the same session between 2013 and 2016 at a single tertiary referral centre. INTERVENTION: All men underwent 1.5-T mpMRI with an endorectal coil. All biopsies were performed by three operators as their first cases of targeted biopsy. Lesions with a Prostate Imaging Recording and Data System (PI-RADS) v.2 score of >=3 detected at mpMRI were targeted. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: csPCa was defined as disease with a Gleason score at biopsy of >=7. Operator expertise was coded as the progressive number of targeted biopsies performed by each physician. Multivariable logistic regression analyses (MVA) were used to assess the association between the targeted biopsy technique (FB vs CB) and operator expertise for detection of csPCa. Covariates consisted of prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, PI-RADS v.2 (3 vs >3), number of targeted cores per MRI lesion, and digital rectal examination (negative vs positive). The same analyses were performed for patients undergoing FB only after accounting for the FB approach (transrectal vs transperineal). A lowess smoothing weighted function was used to graphically assess the effect of operator expertise on the probability of detecting csPCa, after accounting for all confounders. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 157 patients (64%) underwent FB and 87 (36%) underwent CB. The overall csPCa detection rate was 58% for FB and 45% for CB (p=0.07). A significantly higher rate of csPCa detection in targeted samples was observed for FB compared to CB (57% vs 36%; p=0.002). On MVA, FB and operator expertise were significantly associated with a higher probability of csPCa detection in targeted samples (odds ratio [OR] 2.4 and 1.7, respectively; both p<=0.03). When the same analyses were repeated for patients undergoing FB, operator expertise remained an independent predictor of csPCa detection (OR 1.9; p=0.004). An increase in the probability of detecting csPCa with the number of procedures performed was observed after accounting for all confounders. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that FB had higher detection rate than CB for csPCa. Moreover, operator expertise was significantly associated with higher detection rates for csPCa. PATIENT SUMMARY: When different targeted biopsy techniques were compared, fusion biopsy provided a higher detection rate compared to cognitive biopsy for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Moreover, we found that operator expertise was an important predictor of the detection of csPCa, regardless of the procedure used.|Cancer
ID:31101557|Title:Outcomes of disease-specific next-generation sequencing gene panel testing in adolescents and young adults with colorectal cancer.Abstract:PURPOSE: Adolescents and young adults with colorectal cancer (CRC) have attracted recent attention, with a hereditary syndrome identified in one-third of patients diagnosed <= 35. We aimed to study this population to determine if a CRC-specific gene panel increased the yield of testing. METHODS: Patients with CRC <= 35 evaluated from 05/2014-11/2017 were identified from the genetic counseling database. Records were reviewed for personal/family history and genetic counseling outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred forty-three patients with CRC <= 35 were included. One hundred four (72.7%) underwent CRC panel testing. Thirty-nine (27.2%) had syndrome-directed testing, declined, or were lost to follow-up. Forty-two patients had a genetic syndrome (29.4%). Twenty-four of the 42 hereditary patients (57.1%) were identified via syndrome-directed testing. Mutations identified via panel testing were consistent with patient personal/family history. Thirty-three patients had at least one variant of uncertain significance. CONCLUSION: Hereditary syndromes were identified in 29.4% of patients. Panel testing in patients without a phenotype did not increase diagnostic yield, but identified variants in one-third. Disease-specific panel testing is of low yield in young patients without a suggestive personal/family history. Testing broader panels may increase the yield of mutation pick-up in this population, although at the expense of identifying variants.|Cancer
ID:31102358|Title:[Expression of WT1 gene and its prognostic value in patients with acute myeloid leukemia].Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of Wilms'tumor 1 (WT1) gene in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and to explore its application in predicting prognosis of AML in patients with wild or mutated nucleophosmin 1(NPM1) and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD). METHODS: One hundred and sixty-seven newly diagnosed AML patients(exclued M3 type) were enrolled in this study. The survival of patients were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method. The clinical data, laboratory findings and the survival of patients were analyzed and compared between patients with high WT1 expression (high-WT1 group) and those with low WT1 expression (low-WT1 group), as well as among the patients with NPM1 or FLT3-ITD wild type and mutants. RESULTS: The overall response rates (ORR) in high-WT1 and low-WT1 groups were 65.9% (83/126) and 95.1% (39/41), respectively (P<0.01). Compared with the low-WT1 group, the high-WT1 group had lower 2-y overall survival (OS) rate (46.1% vs. 75.2%, P<0.05) and 2-y disease free survival (DFS) rate (43.5% vs. 68.5%, P<0.05). After induction chemotherapy, the patients with decreased WT1 gene expression >= 1log was associated with higher ORR and 2-y OS rate (all P<0.05), but the advantage of 2-y DFS rate was not shown (P>0.05). In patients with NPM1 wild type, the high-WT1 group had inferior ORR and 2-y OS rate (all P<0.05), while in the patients with FLT3-ITD wild type, the high-WT1 group had inferior ORR, 2-y OS rate and 2-y DFS rate (all P<0.05). In patients with NPM1 or FLT3 -ITD mutations, the WT1 expression had no significantly predicting values in treatment efficacy and survival (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: WT1 gene overexpression indicated poor prognosis of AML patients; the patients with decreased WT1 gene expression >= 1 log after the first induction therapy show better prognosis than those with<1 log. The WT1 gene expression level at diagnosis can be used as an unfavorable prognostic factor for AML patients with NPM1 or FLT3-ITD wild types.|Cancer
ID:31103372|Title:Reactivity with the EpCAM-specific antibodies MOC-31 and Ber-Ep4 in plasma cell neoplasms: a potential diagnostic pitfall in cytology samples.Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a protein expressed on surfaces of healthy epithelia, and is overexpressed in dysplasias and carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) utilizing antibodies that react with EpCAM, such as MOC-31 and Ber-EP4, distinguish reactive mesothelial cells from carcinomas in serous effusions. IHC is crucial in effusions with singly dispersed atypical cells, a scenario with a broad differential, including hematopoietic malignancies. Plasma cell neoplasms (PCN) are the second most common hematopoietic malignancy, manifesting as multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma, with 6% of cases developing serous cavity involvement. Most PCNs are readily recognizable; however, variants that deviate from the classic cytomorphology risk erroneous diagnosis. This study demonstrates EpCAM expression in a subset of PCNs, highlighting a potential diagnostic pitfall in serous effusion cytology. METHODS: A 10-year retrospective search for cytology specimens with a diagnosis of PCN was performed. All cases demonstrating CD138/CD38 and monoclonal immunoglobulin expression, and adequately cellular cell block were included. IHC analysis for MOC-31 and Ber-EP4 was performed using Ventana Benchmark Ultra. Scoring was performed as follows: total IHC score equals the positive proportion (0 = no positive tumor cells; 1 = <1%; 2 = 1-10%; 3 =11-33%; 4 = 34-66%; 5 = 67-100%) plus staining intensity (0, no staining; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong). A score > 4 was considered positive. RESULTS: 2 of 28 (7%) PCNs demonstrated positivity for MOC-31 and Ber-Ep4. CONCLUSION: A subset of PCNs in cytology samples show positivity for MOC-31 and Ber-EP4 which could result in misinterpretation as carcinoma.|Cancer
ID:31103629|Title:HNF1A inhibition induces the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine by targeting ABCB1.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis, and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy remains an effective option for the majority of PDAC patients. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1A) is a tumor-suppressor in PDAC, but its role in gemcitabine chemoresistance of PDAC has not been clarified. METHODS: The function of HNF1A in gemcitabine was detected by overexpression and knockdown of HNF1A in vitro and in vitro. The regulatory network between HNF1A and ABCB1 was further demonstrated by luciferase assays, deletion/mutation reporter construct assays and CHIP assays. FINDINGS: Here, we found that HNF1A expression is significantly associated with gemcitabine sensitivity in PDAC cell lines. Moreover, we identified that HNF1A overexpression enhanced gemcitabine sensitivity of PDAC both in vitro and in vitro, while inhibition of HNF1A had the opposite effect. Furthermore, by inhibiting and overexpressing HNF1A, we revealed that HNF1A regulates the expression of MDR genes (ABCB1 and ABCC1) in PDAC cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that HNF1A regulates ABCB1 expression through binding to its specific promoter region and suppressing its transcription levels. Finally, the survival analyses revealed the clinical value of HNF1A in stratification of gemcitabine sensitive pancreatic cancer patients. INTERPRETATION: Our study paved the road for finding novel treatment combinations using conventional cytotoxic agents with functional restoration of the HNF1A protein, individualized treatment through HNF1A staining and improvement of the prognosis of PDAC patients.

ID:31105705|Title:Functional Antibody Responses Following Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for TP53 Mutant pre-B-ALL in a Patient With X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia.Abstract:Patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) have failure of B-cell development with lack of immunoglobulin (Ig) production. While immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT) is beneficial, XLA patients remain at risk for infections, structural lung damage, and rarely, neoplasia. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) may offer a potential cure, but is associated with significant life-threatening complications. Here, we present a 25-year old XLA patient who developed pre-B acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) with somatic TP53 mutation, and treatment for this high-risk malignancy involved full myeloablative conditioning and a HLA-matched sibling alloSCT. Full donor chimerism was achieved for CD3+ and CD3- cell fractions. The patient remains in morphological and flow cytometric remission 14 months post-transplant, with late-onset oral GvHD requiring low dose prednisolone and cyclosporin. Following IgRT discontinuation at 4 months post-transplantation, humoral immunity was established within 14 months as reflected by normal numbers of total B cells, memory B cells, serum IgG, IgM, and IgA, and production of specific IgG responses to Prevenar-13 vaccination. This is only the second reported case of an XLA patient with pre-B-ALL, and the most detailed report of engraftment following alloSCT in XLA. Together with the two previous XLA cases treated with alloSCT, our report provides evidence for the potential for successful humoral reconstitution with alloSCT in patients with B-cell intrinsic antibody deficiency. These observations may be relevant given IgRT, while beneficial, remains an imperfect solution to long-term infectious complications.|Cancer
ID:31108964|Title:Future Options of Molecular-Targeted Therapy in Small Cell Lung Cancer.Abstract:Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. With a focus on histology, there are two major subtypes: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (the more frequent subtype), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (the more aggressive one). Even though SCLC, in general, is a chemosensitive malignancy, relapses following induction therapy are frequent. The standard of care treatment of SCLC consists of platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with etoposide that is subsequently enhanced by PD-L1-inhibiting atezolizumab in the extensive-stage disease, as the addition of immune-checkpoint inhibition yielded improved overall survival. Although there are promising molecular pathways with potential therapeutic impacts, targeted therapies are still not an integral part of routine treatment. Against this background, we evaluated current literature for potential new molecular candidates such as surface markers (e.g., DLL3, TROP-2 or CD56), apoptotic factors (e.g., BCL-2, BET), genetic alterations (e.g., CREBBP, NOTCH or PTEN) or vascular markers (e.g., VEGF, FGFR1 or CD13). Apart from these factors, the application of so-called 'poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerases' (PARP) inhibitors can influence tumor repair mechanisms and thus offer new perspectives for future treatment. Another promising therapeutic concept is the inhibition of 'enhancer of zeste homolog 2' (EZH2) in the loss of function of tumor suppressors or amplification of (proto-) oncogenes. Considering the poor prognosis of SCLC patients, new molecular pathways require further investigation to augment our therapeutic armamentarium in the future.|Cancer
ID:31109278|Title:A Computer - Aided Drug Designing for Pharmacological Inhibition of Mutant ALK for the Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most common among all the types of cancer worldwide with 1.8 million people diagnosed every year, leading to 1.6 million deaths every year according to the American cancer society. The involvement of mutated Anaplasic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) positive fusion protein in the progression of NSCLC has made a propitious target to inhibit and treat NSCLC. In the present study, the main motif is to screen the most effective inhibitor against ALK protein with the potential pharmacological profile. The ligands selected were docked with Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) and CEP-37440 (PubChem CID- 71721648) was the best docked pre-established compound with a permissible pharmacological profile. METHODS: The selected ligands were docked with Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD). With reference to the obtained compound with the lowest re-rank score, PubChem database was virtually screened to retrieve a large set of similar compounds which were docked to find the compound with higher affinity. Further comparative studies and in silico prediction included pharmacophore studies, proximity energy parameters, ADMET and BOILED-egg plot analysis. RESULTS: CEP-37440 (PubChem CID- 71721648) was the best docked pre-established compound with preferable pharmacological profile and PubChem compound CID-123449015 came out as the most efficient virtually screened inhibitor. Interestingly, the contours of the virtual screened compound PubChem CID- 123449015 fall within our desired high volume cavity of protein having admirable property to control the ALK regulation to prevent carcinogenesis in NSCLC. BOILED-Egg plot analysis depicts that both the compounds have analogous characteristics in the divergent aspects. Moreover, in the evaluations of Blood Brain Barrier, Human Intestinal Absorption, AMES toxicity, and LD50, the virtually screened compound (PubChem CID-123449015) was found within high optimization. CONCLUSION: These investigations denote that the virtually screened compound (PubChem CID- 123449015) is more efficient to be a better prospective candidate for NSCLC treatment having good pharmacological profile than the pre-established compound CEP-37440 (PubChem CID- 71721648) with low re-rank score. The identified virtually screened compound has high potential to act as an ALK inhibitor and can show promising results in the research of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).|Cancer
ID:31109360|Title:Rare cases of primary central nervous system anaplastic variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system (CNS) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a rare intracranial tumor, defined as DLBCL arising from the brain, spinal cord, leptomeninges and eye, with an overall annual incidence of 5 cases per million. The primary CNS anaplastic variant of DLBCL (A-DLBCL) is even less common; to our knowledge, there are only two other case reports in the literature. The aim of this report is to present rare cases of primary CNS A-DLBCL and study their clinicopathologic and genetic features. CASE PRESENTATION: We report 3 patients, two men and one woman, aged 54, 55 and 67 years old, with primary CNS A-DLBCL. All 3 patients had a high International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG) score; although the patients were treated with methotrexate-based regimens and/or with radiation therapy, the overall survival was only 2, 5, and 8 months. All 3 patients presented with characteristic features of perivascular space infiltration with bizarre-shaped tumor cells, leading to the diagnosis of primary CNS A-DLBCL. Concurrent of MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 abnormalities and MYC/BCL2 double-expressor DLBCL occurred in all 3 patients; two patients had MYC/BCL2/BCL6 triple extra copies, and one patient had MYC extra copy and BCL6 translocation. All 3 patients displayed mutations in MYD88 L265P and nuclear positivity for RELA, RELB and/or c-Rel, indicating constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These cases shed light on the unique genetic alterations and biological features of primary CNS A-DLBCL. Patients with primary CNS A-DLBCL may often have a MYC/BCL2 double-expressor and concurrent MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 genetic abnormalities, as well as constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. Primary CNS A-DLBCL follows a very aggressive disease course and poor prognosis. In the future, a large number of cases should be analyzed, and the evaluation of molecular genetic characteristics could help with practical and therapeutic implications for primary CNS A-DLBCL.|Cancer
ID:31110352|Title:Release of paused RNA polymerase II at specific loci favors DNA double-strand-break formation and promotes cancer translocations.Abstract:It is not clear how spontaneous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) form and are processed in normal cells, and whether they predispose to cancer-associated translocations. We show that DSBs in normal mammary cells form upon release of paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at promoters, 5' splice sites and active enhancers, and are processed by end-joining in the absence of a canonical DNA-damage response. Logistic and causal-association models showed that Pol II pausing at long genes is the main predictor and determinant of DSBs. Damaged introns with paused Pol II-pS5, TOP2B and XRCC4 are enriched in translocation breakpoints, and map at topologically associating domain boundary-flanking regions showing high interaction frequencies with distal loci. Thus, in unperturbed growth conditions, release of paused Pol II at specific loci and chromatin territories favors DSB formation, leading to chromosomal translocations.|Cancer
ID:31115156|Title:Comprehensive evaluation of context dependence of the prognostic impact of MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma: A report from the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) project.Abstract:BACKGROUND: MYCN amplification (MYCN-A) is an established adverse prognostic factor in neuroblastoma. The extent to which the prognostic impact of MYCN-A depends on other factors has not been fully characterized. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group database, we constructed Cox models of overall survival (OS) to obtain hazard ratios of the effect of MYCN-A within subgroups defined by other prognostic factors. Cox models assessed the degree to which the prognostic impact of MYCN-A was modulated by each other covariate. We used absolute hazard ratio (HR) differences to construct classification trees to identify subgroups with greatest differential prognostic effect of MYCN-A. RESULTS: In a cohort of 6223 patients with known MYCN status, the OS hazard ratio associated with MYCN-A was 6.3 (95% confidence interval 5.7-7.0, P < .001). Age at diagnosis conferred the largest HR absolute difference for MYCN-A between subgroups (HR absolute difference 16.6; HRs for MYCN-A of 19.6 for <18 months, 3.0 for >=18 months). MYCN-A remained significantly prognostic of OS after controlling for other factors, abrogating their prognostic strength. Patients whose outcome was most impacted by MYCN status were those who were <18 months, had high mitosis karrhyohexis index (MKI) and low ferritin. CONCLUSION: The prognostic strength of MYCN-A varies depending on which patient subgroup defined by other neuroblastoma risk factors is examined, with greatest strength in patients with otherwise favorable features. MYCN-A has little effect within some subgroups, aiding clinical decision-making if MYCN status cannot be assessed. Subgroups where MYCN-A has large effect may be prioritized for agents targeting Myc family proteins.|Cancer
ID:31115855|Title:Papillary Thyroid Cancers with Focal Tall Cell Change are as Aggressive as Tall Cell Variants and Should Not be Considered as Low-Risk Disease.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is as an aggressive histological variant. The proportion of tall cells needed to influence prognosis is debated. METHODS: Patients with PTC and tall cells, defined as having a height-to-width ratio of >= 3:1, seen at a high-volume center between 2001 and 2015, were reviewed. Specimens were classified as (1) focal tall cell change, containing < 30% of tall cells; (2) tall cell variant, >= 30% of tall cells; and (3) control cases selected from infiltrative classical PTCs without adverse cytologic features. Univariate, sensitivity, and multivariate analyses were performed with persistent/recurrent disease as the primary outcome. RESULTS: We identified 96 PTCs with focal tall cell change, 35 with the tall cell variant and 104 control cases. Factors associated with poor clinical prognosis were significantly greater in those with focal tall cell change and tall cell variants. Regarding primary outcome, hazard ratios were 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-5.7) for focal tall cell change, and 3.4 (95% CI 1.2-8.7) for tall cell variants compared with controls. Five-year disease-free survival was higher for the control group (92.7%, CI 87.4-98.0) compared with focal tall cell change (76.3%, CI 66.1-86.5) and the tall cell variant (62.2%, CI 43.2-81.2). When stratified in groups consisting of tall cell proportions (< 10%, 10-19%, 20-29% and >= 30%), identification of >= 10% tall cell change was associated with worse outcome (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: PTCs with >= 10% tall cell change have worse prognosis than those without tall cells. Our data indicate that thyroid cancer management guidelines should consider PTCs with focal tall cell change outside of the low-risk classification.|Cancer
ID:31119365|Title:[Microsatellite instability : Review of methods and applications].Abstract:After introduction of the Bethesda microsatellite test panel demonstration of microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or loss of mismatch repair proteins (MMRD) was primarily used as a marker for cancer predisposition of Lynch syndrome (LS, previous: HNPCC). Nowadays MSI/MMRD has become an important biomarker to predict therapy response to checkpoint immunotherapies. MSI can be determined either by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technologies with or without specification of fragment sizes or next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. Depending on the individual tumor entities, these test methods are used differently. Currently, MSI/MMRD is a tumor biomarker which covers a broad spectrum of indications in tumor pathology, especially in colorectal, endometrial and gastric cancer. In advanced carcinomas, MSI is an established predictor of therapy response to checkpoint-directed immunotherapies.|Cancer
ID:31124195|Title:KIT mutation in a naive succinate dehydrogenase-deficient gastric GIST.Abstract:Up to 85% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) harbor mutually exclusive mutations in the KIT or the PDGFRA gene. Among others, known as wild type GIST, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient tumors develop due to genetic or epigenetic alterations in any of four SDH genes. Herein, we present a unique case of SDH-deficient GIST with an unusual heterogeneous SDHA and SDHB staining pattern and mutations detected in the SDHA and KIT gene. A 50-year-old patient presented with a 5 cm large gastric tumor with a multinodular/plexiform growth pattern, mixed epithelioid and spindle cell morphology, and focal pronounced nuclear atypia with hyperchromasia and high mitotic activity. Immunohistochemically, CD117 and DOG-1 were positive. SDHB and SDHA stains showed loss of expression in some of the nodules, whereas others presented with an unusually weak patchy positivity. Molecular analysis revealed a point mutation in exon 5 of the SDHA gene and a mutation in exon 11 of the KIT gene. We hypothesize that based on the allele frequency of SDHA and KIT mutations the tumor is best regarded as SDH-deficient GIST in which the SDHA mutation represents the most likely driver mutation. The identified KIT mutation raises the distinct possibility that the KIT mutation is a secondary event reflecting clonal evolution. This is the first case of a treatment naive GIST harboring a somatic SDHA and a KIT mutation, challenging the dogma that oncogenic mutations in treatment naive GIST are mutually exclusive.|Cancer
ID:31137165|Title:[Differences in circRNA expression profiles between HER-2-positive breast cancer cells and normal mammary epithelial cells].Abstract:Objective: To investigate the differential expression profiles of circular RNA (circRNA) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) positive breast cancer cells and normal mammary epithelial cells, and to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic markers for HER-2 positive breast cancer. Methods: Total RNA were extracted from HER-2 positive breast cancer cell SK-BR-3 and normal mammary epithelial cell MCF10A. RNA quality was detected using NanoDrop ND-1000. Rnase R was applied to remove linear RNA and enrich circRNAs. After amplification and reverse transcription into fluorescent complementary RNA (cRNA) using random primer, the labeled cRNAs were hybridized onto the Arraystar Human circRNA Arrays. The raw data were extracted and the acquired array images were subjected to quantile normalization followed by heat map and volcano plot analysis. The expression of circRNAs with large fold change was verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Finally, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed in the differentially expressed circRNAs and circRNA-microRNA (miRNA) network was constructed. Results: The total RNA extracted from SK-BR-3 and MCF10A had high integrity and quality. The expression profiles of circRNA in SK-BR-3 and MCF10A cells were significantly different shown by fluorescent expression signals. Compared with MCF10A cells, there were 6 584 up-regulated circRNAs and 6254 down-regulated circRNAs in SK-BR-3 cells. There were 348 circRNAs with  log(2)FC >=2, of which 153 were up-regulated and 195 were down-regulated. Moreover, 8 circRNAs with  log(2)FC >5. Among them, 5 were up-regulated in SK-BR-3 cells, including hsa_circRNA_074595 ( log(2)FC =7.84), hsa_circRNA_074598 ( log(2)FC =6.50), hsa_circRNA_085362 ( log(2)FC =5.86), hsa_circRNA_101379 ( log(2)FC =5.71) and hsa_circRNA_406683 ( log(2)FC =5.34); as well as 3 were down-regulated, including hsa_circRNA_021714 ( log(2)FC =5.46), hsa_circRNA_100777 ( log(2)FC =5.40), and hsa_circRNA_100796 ( log(2)FC =5.03). The expression levels of hsa_circRNA_074595, hsa_circRNA_074598 and hsa_circRNA_100777 were further validated by RT-qPCR in consistent with the results of microarray. GO analysis showed that differentially expressed circRNAs were significantly enriched in the biological process of heart development (P<0.001), cellular component in the cell adhesion-related components (P<0.001), molecular function in protein serine/threonine kinase activity (P<0.001). KEGG analysis revealed that differentially expressed circRNAs were significantly enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Conclusions: The expression profile of circRNA in HER-2 positive breast cancer cells is significantly different from that in normal mammary epithelial cells. The differentially expressed circRNAs may be served as potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets for HER-2 positive breast cancer.|Cancer
ID:31138334|Title:Prognostic value of B cells in cutaneous melanoma.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Measures of the adaptive immune response have prognostic and predictive associations in melanoma and other cancer types. Specifically, intratumoral T cell density and function have considerable prognostic and predictive value in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). Less is known about the significance of tumor-infiltrating B cells in SKCM. Our goal was to understand the prognostic and predictive value of B cell phenotypic subsets in SKCM using RNA sequencing. METHODS: We used our previously published algorithm, V'DJer, to assemble B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires and estimate diversity from short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We applied machine learning-based cellular phenotype classifiers to measure relative similarity of bulk tumor sample gene expression profiles and different B cell phenotypes. We assessed these aspects of B cell biology in 473 SKCM from the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) as well as in RNA-seq data corresponding to tumor samples procured from patients who received CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitors for metastatic SKCM. RESULTS: We found that the BCR repertoire was associated with different clinical factors, such as tumor tissue site and sex. However, increased clonality of the BCR repertoire was favorably prognostic in SKCM and was prognostic even after first conditioning on various clinical factors. Mutation burden was not correlated with any BCR measurement, and no specific mutation had an altered BCR repertoire. Lack of an assembled BCR in pre-treatment tumor tissues was associated with a lack of anti-tumor response to a CTLA-4 inhibitor in metastatic SKCM. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an important prognostic and predictive role for B cell characteristics in SKCM. This has implications for melanoma immunobiology and potential development of immunogenomics features to predict survival and response to immunotherapy.|Cancer
ID:31138587|Title:Tumor-Localized Costimulatory T-Cell Engagement by the 4-1BB/HER2 Bispecific Antibody-Anticalin Fusion PRS-343.Abstract:PURPOSE: 4-1BB (CD137) is a key costimulatory immunoreceptor and promising therapeutic target in cancer. To overcome limitations of current 4-1BB-targeting antibodies, we have developed PRS-343, a 4-1BB/HER2 bispecific molecule. PRS-343 is designed to facilitate T-cell costimulation by tumor-localized, HER2-dependent 4-1BB clustering and activation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: PRS-343 was generated by the genetic fusion of 4-1BB-specific Anticalin proteins to a variant of trastuzumab with an engineered IgG4 isotype. Its activity was characterized using a panel of in vitro assays and humanized mouse models. The safety was assessed using ex vivo human cell assays and a toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. RESULTS: PRS-343 targets 4-1BB and HER2 with high affinity and binds both targets simultaneously. 4-1BB-expressing T cells are efficiently costimulated when incubated with PRS-343 in the presence of cancer cells expressing HER2, as evidenced by increased production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL2, GM-CSF, TNFalpha, and IFNgamma). In a humanized mouse model engrafted with HER2-positive SK-OV-3 tumor cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PRS-343 leads to tumor growth inhibition and a dose-dependent increase of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In IND-enabling studies, PRS-343 was found to be well tolerated, with no overt toxicity and no relevant drug-related toxicologic findings. CONCLUSIONS: PRS-343 facilitates tumor-localized targeting of T cells by bispecific engagement of HER2 and 4-1BB. This approach has the potential to provide a more localized activation of the immune system with higher efficacy and reduced peripheral toxicity compared with current monospecific approaches. The reported data led to initiation of a phase I clinical trial with this first-in-class molecule.See related commentary by Su et al., p. 5732.|Cancer
ID:31148183|Title:A Noncoding Regulatory RNAs Network Driven by Circ-CDYL Acts Specifically in the Early Stages Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Abstract:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the fastest-rising causes of cancer-related death worldwide, but its deficiency of specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the early stages lead to severe inadequacy in the early diagnosis and treatment of HCC. Covalently closed circular RNA (circRNA), which was once considered an aberrant splicing by-product, is now drawing new interest in cancer research because of its remarkable functionality. Beneath the surface of the dominant functional proteins events, a hidden circRNA-centric noncoding regulatory RNAs network active in the very early stage of HCC is here revealed by a genome-wide analysis of mRNA, circRNA, and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles. Circ-CDYL (chromodomain Y like) is specifically up-regulated in the early stages of HCC and therefore contributes to the properties of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM)-positive liver tumor-initiating cells. Circ-CDYL interacts with mRNAs encoding hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor asparagine hydroxylase (HIF1AN) by acting as the sponge of miR-892a and miR-328-3p, respectively. Subsequently, activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT serine/threonine kinase-mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1/beta-catenin and NOTCH2 pathways, which promote the expression of the effect proteins, baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 (BIRC5 or SURVIVIN) and MYC proto-oncogene, is influenced by circ-CDYL. A treatment incorporating circ-CDYL interference and traditional enzyme inhibitors targeting PI3K and HIF1AN demonstrated highly effective inhibition of stem-like characteristics and tumor growth in HCC. Finally, we demonstrated that circ-CDYL expression or which combined with HDGF and HIF1AN are both independent markers for discrimination of early stages of HCC with the odds ratios of 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.17) and 124.58 (95% CI, 13.26-1170.56), respectively. Conclusion: These findings uncover a circRNA-centric noncoding regulatory RNAs network in the early stages of HCC and thus provide a possibility for surveillance and early treatment of HCC.|Cancer
ID:31152596|Title:The role of gene fusions in melanocytic neoplasms.Abstract:Recent advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed for efficient whole transcriptome sequencing, leading to the identification of important kinase fusions as the primary driver in some melanocytic neoplasms. These fusions typically occur mutually exclusively of one another and other well-known initiating mutations such as BRAF, NRAS, NF1, KIT, and GNAQ. Fusions are found in over 50% of Spitz neoplasms, including ALK, BRAF, NTRK1, NTRK3, ROS1, MET, MAP3K8, and RET. Familiarity with the typical morphologic features of certain fusion-driven melanocytic neoplasms can help with classification, diagnosis, and identification of targeted molecular therapies in malignant cases. Spitz tumors with ALK, NTRK1, and NTRK3 fusions have characteristic morphologic features. BRAF and MAP3K8 fusions, in particular, tend to be epithelioid, high grade, and more frequent in Spitz melanoma than other fusion subtypes. Sporadic cases of pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma may have PRKCA fusions and sheets of monomorphic epithelioid melanocytes. Fusion events are also enriched among melanomas without the key mutations BRAF, NRAS, or NF1. Although NGS is the most reliable method to detect fusions, immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization are cost-effective alternatives in some cases. We describe recent discoveries regarding the role of kinase fusions in melanocytic neoplasms and their associated morphologies.|Cancer
ID:31157977|Title:Analysis of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus gallolyticus in saliva of colorectal cancer patients.Abstract:Aim: The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence and amount of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Streptococcus gallolyticus (Sg) in the saliva of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and controls. Methods: PCR analyses performed in 71 CRC patients and 77 controls. Results: Saliva samples of patients had higher amounts of Fn (p = 0.001) and Sg (p < 0.001) compared with controls. Amount of Fn and Sg were lower in the microsatellite instability (+) group. Evaluation of salivary Sg amount by receiver operating characteristics analysis found to have diagnostic value for CRC (AUC: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.72-0.96). Conclusion: We found higher amounts of Fn and Sg in the saliva of CRC patients. Salivary Sg could helpful in distinction of CRC.|Cancer
ID:31158106|Title:Clinical implications of genetic aberrations in metastatic prostate cancer.Abstract:PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The utility of tumor genetic testing in metastatic prostate cancer is rapidly evolving - especially in respect to finding prognostic and predictive biomarkers. In this review, we describe genomic aberrations in clinically relevant pathways in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) for which therapeutic targeting is possible. RECENT FINDINGS: Recognizing the diverse array of genetic features within prostate cancer, the goal of testing in mCRPC is to match an individual patients' tumor with the best therapy. Approximately 20-25% of mCRPC patients have defects in DNA repair, which may be exploited with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors, platinum-based chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy. Choosing between the second-generation androgen inhibitors and chemotherapy may be informed through testing for androgen receptor splice variants or androgen receptor amplifications, but technology and outcomes are still being clarified. Genetic testing for mismatch repair deficiency (1% of mCRPC patients) is a standard of care, but may be expanded as other subpopulations that could respond to immunotherapy are found. SUMMARY: The era of precision medicine for prostate cancer is here, but is being refined. Further studies with newer technology and standardized analytical platforms are needed and must be matched with improvement in clinical care infrastructure.|Cancer
ID:31158302|Title:Clinicopathological features, diagnosis, and treatment of sessile serrated adenoma/polyp with dysplasia/carcinoma.Abstract:Sessile serrated adenoma/polyps (SSA/Ps) are early precursor lesions in the serrated neoplasia pathway, which results in BRAF-mutated colorectal carcinomas with not only high levels of microsatellite instability but also microsatellite stable. SSA/Ps with advanced histology, including cytological dysplasia or minimally invasive carcinomas, are important lesions because SSA/Ps are considered major contributors to "interval cancers" and these lesions can rapidly become dysplastic or invasive carcinomas. Clinicopathologically, SSA/Ps with dysplasia or invasive carcinoma were associated with advanced age, female sex, and proximal colon. Although SSA/Ps with submucosal invasive carcinoma were smaller and invaded less deeply into the submucosal layer than conventional tubular adenomas with submucosal invasive carcinoma, SSA/Ps with submucosal invasive carcinoma frequently had a mucinous component and exhibited a higher potential for lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis. In an SSA/P series, endoscopic characteristics, including (semi)pedunculated morphology, double elevation, central depression, and reddishness, may help accurately diagnose SSA/Ps with advanced histology. Removal of SSA/Ps with dysplasia or invasive carcinoma was recommended. Endoscopic treatment such as endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection is useful for those lesions. However, surgical resection with lymph node dissection might be indicated when SSA/Ps with invasive carcinoma are endoscopically suspected, because these have the high risk of lymph node metastasis. Greater awareness may promote further research into improving the detection, recognition, and complete resection rates of SSA/Ps with dysplasia or invasive carcinoma and reduce the interval cancer rates.|Cancer
ID:31160360|Title:Elucidating a false-negative MYC break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization probe study by next-generation sequencing in a patient with high-grade B-cell lymphoma with IGH/MYC and IGH/BCL2 rearrangements.Abstract:The identification of MYC rearrangements in several mature B-cell neoplasms is critical for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Commercially available fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe sets, including IGH/MYC dual-color dual-fusion (D-FISH) and MYC break-apart probes (BAPs), serve as the primary methodology utilized to detect MYC rearrangements. However, performing either IGH/MYC D-FISH or MYC BAP FISH studies in isolation has been reported to result in false-negative results because of the complex nature of 8q24 rearrangements involving the MYC gene region. We report a 60-yr-old male with newly diagnosed high-grade B-cell lymphoma with a negative MYC BAP study, but with positive BCL2 and BCL6 BAP studies. Per our current laboratory algorithm to concurrently interrogate the MYC gene region with both MYC BAP and IGH/MYC D-FISH probe sets, we performed IGH/MYC D-FISH studies and detected an IGH/MYC fusion. To further characterize the discrepant MYC results obtained by FISH, a next-generation sequencing strategy, mate-pair sequencing (MPseq), was performed and revealed a small insertion (~200 kb) of the IGH locus downstream from the MYC gene that was undetectable by MYC BAP studies. This case highlights the importance of utilizing both IGH/MYC D-FISH and MYC BAP sets to detect potential cryptic MYC rearrangements and also demonstrates the power of MPseq to characterize complex structural rearrangements and copy-number abnormalities unappreciable by FISH.|Cancer
ID:31163629|Title:Prostaglandin E-Major Urinary Metabolite (PGE-MUM) as a Tumor Marker for Lung Adenocarcinoma.Abstract:Background: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is metabolized to prostaglandin E-major urinary metabolite (PGE-MUM). Enhanced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression demonstrated in lung adenocarcinoma indicates increased PGE-MUM levels in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Objectives: We aimed to elucidate the clinical usefulness of measuring PGE-MUM as an indicator of tumor burden in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: PGE-MUM was measured by a radioimmunoassay in control healthy volunteers (n = 124) and patients with lung adenocarcinoma (n = 54). Associations between PGE-MUM levels and clinical characteristics of the patients (including lung cancer stage and TNM factors (T: Tumor, N: Node, M: Metastasis) were examined. Results: PGE-MUM levels were significantly elevated in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. A PGE-MUM level of 14.9 mug/g Cr showed 70.4% sensitivity and 67.7% specificity for the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. PGE-MUM levels tended to be positively correlated with cancer progression as determined by the TNM staging system. Advanced stage (stage III, stage IV, and recurrence) was significantly associated with high PGE-MUM levels by logistic regression analysis. No apparent correlation was demonstrated between PGE-MUM and carcinoma embryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Conclusions: PGE-MUM can be a promising biomarker reflecting the systemic tumor burden of lung adenocarcinoma.|Cancer

We present a 51-year-old man complaining of sudden loss of vision in the right eye along with multiple superficial retinal haemorrhages and perivascular infiltration. Fundus fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography confirmed the diagnosis of inflammatory central retinal vein occlusion with macular oedema which mimicked frosted branch angiitis. Laboratory tests and bone marrow biopsy confirmed underlying systemic disease to be Janus kinase 2 mutation positive primary idiopathic myelofibrosis.

In view of his systemic disease, he was started on systemic chemotherapy and oral corticosteroid which helped in stabilising the eye condition.|Cancer
ID:31164412|Title:T-Cell Deletion of MyD88 Connects IL17 and IkappaBzeta to RAS Oncogenesis.Abstract:Cancer development requires a favorable tissue microenvironment. By deleting Myd88 in keratinocytes or specific bone marrow subpopulations in oncogenic RAS-mediated skin carcinogenesis, we show that IL17 from infiltrating T cells and IkappaBzeta signaling in keratinocytes are essential to produce a permissive microenvironment and tumor formation. Both normal and RAS-transformed keratinocytes respond to tumor promoters by activating canonical NF-kappaB and IkappaBzeta signaling, releasing specific cytokines and chemokines that attract Th17 cells through MyD88-dependent signaling in T cells. The release of IL17 into the microenvironment elevates IkappaBzeta in normal and RAS-transformed keratinocytes. Activation of IkappaBzeta signaling is required for the expression of specific promoting factors induced by IL17 in normal keratinocytes and constitutively expressed in RAS-initiated keratinocytes. Deletion of Nfkbiz in keratinocytes impairs RAS-mediated benign tumor formation. Transcriptional profiling and gene set enrichment analysis of IkappaBzeta-deficient RAS-initiated keratinocytes indicate that IkappaBzeta signaling is common for RAS transformation of multiple epithelial cancers. Probing The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets using this transcriptional profile indicates that reduction of IkappaBzeta signaling during cancer progression associates with poor prognosis in RAS-driven human cancers. IMPLICATIONS: The paradox that elevation of IkappaBzeta and stimulation of IkappaBzeta signaling through tumor extrinsic factors is required for RAS-mediated benign tumor formation while relative IkappaBzeta expression is reduced in advanced cancers with poor prognosis implies that tumor cells switch from microenvironmental dependency early in carcinogenesis to cell-autonomous pathways during cancer progression.|Cancer
ID:31165234|Title:[Complexity of PEComas : Diagnostic approach, molecular background, clinical management (German version)].Abstract:Perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms (PEComas) are a family of mesenchymal neoplasms with features of both melanotic and smooth muscle differentiation. PEComa morphology is highly variable and encompasses epithelioid to spindle cells often with clear cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Molecularly, most PEComas are defined by a loss of function of the TSC1/TSC2 complex. Additionally, a distinct small subset of PEComas harboring rearrangements of the TFE3 (Xp11) gene locus has been identified. By presenting a series of three case reports with distinct features, we demonstrate diagnostic pitfalls as well as the importance of molecular work-up of PEComas because of important therapeutic consequences.|Cancer
ID:31167492|Title:Liquid Biopsies for Ovarian Carcinoma: How Blood Tests May Improve the Clinical Management of a Deadly Disease.Abstract:Ovarian cancers (OvC) are frequent, with more than 22,000 new cases each year for 14,000 deaths in the United States. Except for patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, diagnostic methods, prognostic tools, and therapeutic strategies have not much improved in the last two decades. High throughput tumor molecular analyses have identified important alterations involved in ovarian carcinoma growth and spreading. However, these data have not modified the clinical management of most of patients. Moreover, tumor sample collection requires invasive procedures not adapted to objectives, such as the screening, prediction, or assessment of treatment efficacy, monitoring of residual disease, and early diagnosis of relapse. In recent years, circulating tumor biomarkers (also known as "liquid biopsies") such as circulating tumor cells, circulating nucleotides (DNA or miRNA), or extracellular vesicles, have been massively explored through various indications, platforms, and goals, but their use has not yet been validated in routine practice. This review describes the methods of analysis and results related to liquid biopsies for ovarian epithelial cancer. The different settings that a patient can go through during her journey with OvC are explored: screening and early diagnosis, prognosis, prediction of response to systemic therapies for advanced stages, and monitoring of residual subclinical disease.|Cancer
ID:31167998|Title:[Acute myeloid leukemia evolving from KIT D816-mutated systemic mastocytosis relapsing two months after completion of chemotherapy].Abstract:Here, we report the case of a 9-year-old girl with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) developed from systemic mastocytosis (SM). She experienced bladder and rectal disturbance due to an extramedullary nodule in the paraspinal region of the sacrum. Cytogenetic and genetic analyses of leukemic cells revealed the KIT D816Y mutation besides t (8;21) (q22:q22) /RUNX1-RUNX1T1. Despite receiving proton beam therapy after conventional chemotherapy, the patient relapsed after 2 months. As SM-AML with the KIT D816 mutation in adults exhibits a poor prognosis, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is recommended. Owing to a few reports of SM-AML in children, the standard therapy for pediatric cases has not been established to date. Based on our experience and the related literature, the prognosis of childhood SM-AML could be as poor as in adults. Hence, further investigation, including mutational analyses of the KIT gene, is warranted to establish a risk-oriented strategy for managing childhood SM-AML.|Cancer
ID:31168000|Title:[Latent essential thrombocythemia becoming perceptible after splenectomy].Abstract:A 47-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of left hypochondrium part pain and was diagnosed with splenomegaly with splenic infarctions in May 2016. His complete blood cell count was almost within normal limits, and a bone marrow biopsy revealed normal cellularity with no fibrosis. In addition, no abnormal uptake was noted on FDG PET/CT. In August 2016, he underwent splenectomy for splenomegaly. The histological examination revealed fibrotic stenosis of the blood vessels in the spleen. After splenectomy, his platelet count elevated and remained at >1,000x109/l 3 months later. Finally, he was diagnosed with latent essential thrombocythemia (ET) because the JAK2V617F mutation was positive. Accordingly, oral hydroxyurea was initiated. Thrombosis could be a complication in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). In our case, ET was masked, perhaps, because of hypersplenism and splenomegaly because of splenic vein thrombosis. Hence, examination of the JAK2V617F mutation in patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis is recommended because of the possibility of latent MPN.|Cancer
ID:31168257|Title:Surgical Management of Carcinoma Vulva-Case Series and Review of Literature.Abstract:The objective of this study was to study the risk factors, management protocols, and the outcome of vulvar cancer cases over a period of 2 years in a tertiary care hospital. This is a case series of early-stage vulvar cancer in the Department of Surgical Oncology in BL Kapur Superspeciality Hospital from Jan 2016 to date. Five patients with histologically proven diagnosis of early-stage vulvar cancer were included. The mean age for the diagnosis of vulvar cancer was 58 years and the peak incidence was seen in postmenopausal age group. All of the cases were squamous cell carcinomas in stage IB except one which was a basisquamous variant. All cases were treated primarily with surgery and vulvar flap reconstruction. Adjuvant therapy was not given in any case. Cases were followed from 6 months to date, and no recurrence noted. The limitations of the study were rarity of disease and less number of cases. As all the cases in our study were in early stage of disease (stages I and II), surgical treatment in the form of modified radical vulvectomy with B/L inguinofemoral lymph node dissection and oncoplastic procedure was the treatment modality chosen for all the patients.|Cancer
ID:31169702|Title:Intrahepatic adrenocortical adenoma arising from adrenohepatic fusion mimicking hepatic malignancy: Two case reports.Abstract:RATIONALE: Intrahepatic adrenocortical adenoma (IAA) arising from adrenohepatic fusion (AHF) is rare and its imaging findings are not well established. Moreover, it is easily misdiagnosed as malignant hepatic tumor in patients at risk of malignancy. Its key finding is the connection between the tumor and adrenal gland. When IAA from AHF is suspected, biopsy should be considered to avoid unnecessary surgery. Herein, we report 2 cases of IAA from AHF. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 59-year-old woman was admitted due to a 1.5-cm hypoechoic nodule in the right hepatic lobe detected on ultrasound for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance due to chronic hepatitis B. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to evaluate the hepatic mass. Another 75-year-old woman was admitted due to rectal adenocarcinoma detected on colonoscopy. Contrast-enhanced CT depicted a 2.5-cm mass in the right hepatic lobe. DIAGNOSIS: In case 1, CT and MRI showed a 1.5-cm subcapsular mass in the right hepatic lobe with typical findings of HCC in a patient with chronic hepatitis B. The mass was confirmed as IAA from AHF after the laparoscopic surgery. In case 2, CT showed advanced rectal malignancy and a 2.5-cm poorly enhancing mass in the right hepatic lobe. The tentative diagnosis was hepatic metastasis. However, based on the connection between the tumor and adrenal gland during preoperative review, the presumed diagnosis was changed to IAA from AHF, which was confirmed on biopsy. INTERVENTIONS: The hepatic mass connected with the right adrenal gland was laparoscopically resected in case 1. Laparoscopic lower anterior resection for rectal malignancy and percutaneous biopsy for the hepatic mass were performed in case 2. OUTCOMES: The first patient had an uneventful recovery, without recurrence on the 3-year follow-up CT. The second patient had an uneventful postoperative course and has been alive for 12 months postoperatively without pathologically proven IAA changes on follow-up CT. LESSONS: When hepatic mass is found adjacent to the right adrenal gland on imaging, the connection between the tumor and adrenal gland should be investigated. When IAA arising from AHF is suspected, biopsy should be considered to avoid unnecessary surgery.|Cancer
ID:31171119|Title:Hereditary Cancer Syndromes-A Primer on Diagnosis and Management: Part 1: Breast-Ovarian Cancer Syndromes.Abstract:Cancer is the second leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States, with colorectal cancer and breast cancer being two of the most frequent cancer types. Hereditary causes occurring due to pathogenic sequence variants and defects in certain genes makes up roughly 5% of all colorectal cancers and breast-ovarian cancers. High-risk hereditary predisposition syndromes have been associated with a substantially increased lifetime risk for the development of colorectal cancers and breast-ovarian cancers depending on the genetic syndrome, and many people also carry an increased risk of several other cancers compared with the general population. The aim of this review was to provide comprehensive literature on the most commonly encountered hereditary predisposition syndromes, including Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, MUTYH-associated polyposis, hamartomatous polyposis, and breast-ovarian cancer conditions. This will be presented as a 2-part series: the first part will cover the breast-ovarian cancer syndromes, and the second will focus on the inherited colorectal cancer and polyposis conditions.|Cancer

ID:31177117|Title:Overexpression of Galectin-3 in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Is Associated With 17p Deletion: A Short Report.Abstract:BACKGROUND/AIM: Galectins belong to the family of galactose-binding proteins known to play an important role in the processes of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and neoplastic progression. Herein, we studied the expression of galectin-3 (Gal-3) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of Gal-3 was analyzed by means of multiparametric flow cytometry in normal and pathological B-cells from peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of 67 patients with CLL. RESULTS: Pathological B-cells expressed significantly higher levels of cytoplasmic Gal-3 than normal B-cells. Moreover, overexpression of cytoplasmic Gal-3 was observed in the prognostically poorest subgroup of CLL patients, namely those with 17p deletion. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a possible role of galectin-3 in CLL pathophysiology and its potential value as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target.|Cancer
ID:31177124|Title:Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) Q192R and L55M Polymorphisms as Potential Predisposition Factors for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.Abstract:BACKGROUND/AIM: PON1 gene has an executive role in antioxidant defense, protecting cells from genotoxic factors. Q192R and L55M PON1 polymorphisms reduce catalytic activity of the encoded protein. These polymorphisms were studied in 300 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and 106 healthy donors. They were also associated with patients' cytogenetic findings, to investigate their possible implication in CLL pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SNP genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Karyotypic analysis was also performed by chromosome G-banding analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Genotypic and allelic distribution of Q192R polymorphism showed a statistically significant higher frequency of mutant genotypes and mutant alleles in patients compared to controls. The same observation was noted in patients with abnormal karyotypes and those carrying abn14q32 and del(6q). A statistically increased frequency for the mutant allele was also revealed in patients with del(11q). On the contrary, L55M polymorphism showed a similar distribution between patients and controls. CONCLUSION: Q192R polymorphism plays a role in CLL predisposition and the formation of specific chromosomal aberrations.|Cancer
ID:31177126|Title:Targeted Genomic Sequencing Reveals Novel TP53 In-frame Deletion Mutations Leading to p53 Overexpression in High-grade Serous Tubo-ovarian Carcinoma.Abstract:BACKGROUND/AIM: High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common histological subtype of ovarian carcinoma. Somatic mutation of tumor protein 53 (TP53) is a hallmark of tubo-ovarian HGSC and is observed in almost all such cases. Highly sensitive targeted genomic sequencing can be used to identify novel mutations that may become potential druggable targets and aid in therapeutic decisions. The aim of this study was to describe the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of HGSCs with novel somatic TP53 mutations identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A commercial NGS panel comprising 170 genes, including TP53, was used to analyze the genetic profiles of 132 ovarian carcinoma cases. The clinicopathological characteristics and p53 immunostaining results of two HGSCs exhibiting novel TP53 mutations were investigated. RESULTS: Eighty-eight (66.7%) out of 132 ovarian carcinoma cases were diagnosed as HGSC. Novel TP53 in-frame deletion mutations c.719_727delGTTCCTGCA (p53 p.Ser240_Cys242del) and c.634_642delTTTCGACAT (p53 p.F212_H214del) were detected in a single case of HGSC each. Both patients were postmenopausal women. Imaging and laboratory studies revealed peritoneal carcinomatosis and elevated levels of serum tumor markers. The patients underwent primary debulking surgery and were diagnosed as having stage IIIC HGSC. In both cases, p53 immunostaining revealed uniform nuclear immunoreactivity in 90% or more of tumor cells at a very strong intensity. CONCLUSION: Targeted genomic sequencing revealed novel in-frame deletion mutations of TP53 leading to p53 overexpression in tubo-ovarian HGSC. This discovery of previously unreported somatic TP53 mutations provides insight into the translation of NGS technology into personalized medicine and identifies new potential targets for therapeutic applications.|Cancer

ID:31181727|Title:ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6: Novel Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.Abstract:Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common killer among men in Western countries. Targeting androgen receptor (AR) signaling by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the current therapeutic regime for patients newly diagnosed with metastatic PCa. However, most patients relapse and become resistant to ADT, leading to metastatic castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) and eventually death. Several proposed mechanisms have been proposed for CRPC; however, the exact mechanism through which CRPC develops is still unclear. One possible pathway is that the AR remains active in CRPC cases. Therefore, understanding AR signaling networks as primary PCa changes into metastatic CRPC is key to developing future biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for PCa and CRPC. In the current review, we focused on three novel biomarkers (ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6) that were demonstrated to play critical roles in CRPC progression, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) drug resistance, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) for patients treated with ADT or AR inhibition. In addition, we summarize how these potential biomarkers can be used in the clinic for diagnosis and as therapeutic targets of PCa.|Cancer
ID:31182807|Title:The deubiquitinase Otub1 controls the activation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells by regulating IL-15-mediated priming.Abstract:CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells are central cellular components of immune responses against pathogens and cancer, which rely on interleukin (IL)-15 for homeostasis. Here we show that IL-15 also mediates homeostatic priming of CD8+ T cells for antigen-stimulated activation, which is controlled by a deubiquitinase, Otub1. IL-15 mediates membrane recruitment of Otub1, which inhibits ubiquitin-dependent activation of AKT, a kinase that is pivotal for T cell activation and metabolism. Otub1 deficiency in mice causes aberrant responses of CD8+ T cells to IL-15, rendering naive CD8+ T cells hypersensitive to antigen stimulation characterized by enhanced metabolic reprograming and effector functions. Otub1 also controls the maturation and activation of NK cells. Deletion of Otub1 profoundly enhances anticancer immunity by unleashing the activity of CD8+ T cells and NK cells. These findings suggest that Otub1 controls the activation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells by functioning as a checkpoint of IL-15-mediated priming.|Cancer

It also exerts activity towards some but not all rare BRAF substitutions. Proper cataloguing of drug-sensitive and -insensitive rare mutations remains a challenge, due to low occurrence of these events and inability of commercial PCR-based diagnostic kits to detect the full spectrum of BRAF gene lesions. We considered the results of BRAF exon 15 testing in 1872 consecutive melanoma patients. BRAF mutation was identified in 1,090 (58.2%) cases. While drug-sensitive codon 600 substitutions constituted the majority of BRAF gene lesions (V600E: 962 [51.4%]; V600K: 86 [4.6%]; V600R: 17 [0.9%]), the fourth common BRAF allele was K601E accounting for 9 (0.5%) melanoma cases. The data on BRAF inhibitor sensitivity of tumors with K601E substitution are scarce. We administered single-agent vemurafenib to a melanoma patient carrying BRAF K601E mutation as the first-line treatment. Unfortunately, this therapy did not result in a tumor response. Taken together with already published data, this report indicates lack of benefit from conventional BRAF inhibitors in patients with BRAF K601E mutated melanoma.|Cancer
ID:31183193|Title:The roles of p53 and XPO1 on colorectal cancer progression in Yemeni patients.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis is driving by genetic alterations leading to changes in protein expression such as p53. The p53 is frequently expressed in CRC and its association with clinicopathological features is still controversial. Moreover, accumulated evidence suggests that both p53 and nuclear exporter protein, exportin 1 (XPO1), are working in reciprocal manner may lead to loss of p53 nuclear localization and enhance cancer progression through hyperactive nuclear export. Accordingly, the present study aimed to evaluate the expression of p53 in CRC Yemeni patients and to explore the association between the p53 and XPO1 coexpression in relation to clinicopathological features. METHODS: A series of 40 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks taken from CRC patients that diagnosed as adenocarcinoma were prospectively collected and then analyzed for p53 and XPO1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The patients and tumor clinicopathological characteristics were retrieved from the histopathology reports and the P value <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The p53 expression was observed in 60% (24/40) of CRC tumor samples. Significantly, the p53 expression was noted in 72.4% (21/29) of the left side compared to 27.3% (3/11) of the right side colon tumors (P=0.014). Furthermore, p53 expression was positively and significantly correlated with well-but not moderate- or poorly-differentiated tumors (P=0.023). No significant difference was observed between the p53 expression and age, gender and tumor size. Regarding the XPO1 expression, the p53 expression didn't show an association with XPO1 expression. The coexpression of p53 and XPO1 analysis revealed that 100% (11/11) tumors with negative p53 and positive XPO1 coexpression was noted with lymph node metastasis with significant difference (P=0.003) and more frequently observed in moderate-or poorly- differentiated tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The loss of p53 accompanied with increased XPO1 expressions was associated with the progression of histopathological features of CRC Yemeni patients. Further studies are needed to elucidate the p53 genetic mutations in relation to the XPO1 coexpression in CRC prognosis.|Cancer
ID:31183964|Title:Dendritic Polyglycerol-Derived Nano-Architectures as Delivery Platforms of Gemcitabine for Pancreatic Cancer.Abstract:Dendritic polyglycerol-co-polycaprolactone (PG-co-PCL)-derived block copolymers are synthesized and explored as nanoscale drug delivery platforms for a chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine (GEM), which is the cornerstone of therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Current treatment strategies with GEM result in suboptimal therapeutic outcome owing to microenvironmental resistance and rapid metabolic degradation of GEM. To address these challenges, physicochemical and cell-biological properties of both covalently conjugated and non-covalently stabilized variants of GEM-containing PG-co-PCL architectures have been evaluated. Self-assembly behavior, drug loading and release capacity, cytotoxicity, and cellular uptake properties of these constructs in monolayer and in spheroid cultures of PDAC cells are investigated. To realize the covalently conjugated carrier systems, GEM, in conjunction with a tertiary amine, is attached to the polycarbonate block grafted from the PG-co-PCL core. It is observed that pH-dependent ionization properties of these amine side-chains direct the formation of self-assembly of block copolymers in the form of nanoparticles. For non-covalent encapsulation, a facile "solvent-shifting" technique is adopted. Fabrication techniques are found to control colloidal and cellular properties of GEM-loaded nanoconstructs. The feasibility and potential of these newly developed architectures for designing carrier systems for GEM to achieve augmented prognosis for pancreatic cancer are reported.|Cancer
ID:31185671|Title:Minimal Residual Disease Monitoring with Next-Generation Sequencing Methodologies in Hematological Malignancies.Abstract:Ultra-deep next-generation sequencing has emerged in recent years as an important diagnostic tool for the detection and follow-up of tumor burden in most of the known hematopoietic malignancies. Meticulous and high-throughput methods for the lowest possible quantified disease are needed to address the deficiencies of more classical techniques. Precision-based approaches will allow us to correctly stratify each patient based on the minimal residual disease (MRD) after a treatment cycle. In this review, we consider the most prominent ways to approach next-generation sequencing methodologies to follow-up MRD in hematological neoplasms.|Cancer
ID:31186051|Title:Diverse regulatory manners of human telomerase reverse transcriptase.Abstract:Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is the core subunit of human telomerase and plays important roles in human cancers. Aberrant expression of hTERT is closely associated with tumorigenesis, cancer cell stemness maintaining, cell proliferation, apoptosis inhibition, senescence evasion and metastasis. The molecular basis of hTERT regulation is highly complicated and consists of various layers. A deep and full-scale comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms of hTERT is pivotal in understanding the pathogenesis and searching for therapeutic approaches. In this review, we summarize the recent advances regarding the diverse regulatory mechanisms of hTERT, including the transcriptional (promoter mutation, promoter region methylation and histone acetylation), post-transcriptional (mRNA alternative splicing and non-coding RNAs) and post-translational levels (phosphorylation and ubiquitination), which may provide novel perspectives for further translational diagnosis or therapeutic strategies targeting hTERT.|Cancer
ID:31187522|Title:Liquid biopsy in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.Abstract:ctDNA provides an important new strategy that will aid in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Immunoglobulin sequencing provides a tumor specific marker for disease activity with a sensitivity equivalent to one tumor cell per 10-6. Furthermore, it can provide an estimate of tumor bulk and tumor response dynamics during treatment. Interim monitoring can identify patients at high risk of treatment failure and surveillance monitoring can identify patients months before radiographic disease progression. Tumor specific mutations can also be detected in ctDNA and may reflect an averaging of mutations present within multiple tumor masses. Such analysis may aid in the molecular characterization of tumors and selection of targeted treatments for precision medicine.|Cancer

ID:31189972|Title:Acid specific dark quencher QC1 pHLIP for multi-spectral optoacoustic diagnoses of breast cancer.Abstract:Breast cancer is the most common type of malignant growth in women. Early detection of breast cancer, as well as the identification of possible metastatic spread poses a significant challenge because of the structural and genetic heterogeneity that occurs during the progression of the disease. Currently, mammographies, biopsies and MRI scans are the standard of care techniques used for breast cancer diagnosis, all of which have their individual shortfalls, especially when it comes to discriminating tumors and benign growths. With this in mind, we have developed a non-invasive optoacoustic imaging strategy that targets the acidic environment of breast cancer. A pH low insertion peptide (pHLIP) was conjugated to the dark quencher QC1, yielding a non-fluorescent sonophore with high extinction coefficient in the near infrared that increases signal as a function of increasing amounts of membrane insertion. In an orthotopic murine breast cancer model, pHLIP-targeted optoacoustic imaging allowed us to differentiate between healthy and breast cancer tissues with high signal/noise ratios. In vivo, the sonophore QC1-pHLIP could detect malignancies at higher contrast than its fluorescent analog ICG-pHLIP, which was developed for fluorescence-guided surgical applications. PHLIP-type optoacoustic imaging agents in clinical settings are attractive due to their ability to target breast cancer and a wide variety of other malignant growths for diagnostic purposes. Intuitively, these agents could also be used for visualization during surgery.|Cancer
ID:31191019|Title:NSE from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells regulates macrophage polarization.Abstract:Background/aims: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly common type of malignant and heterogeneous non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Tumor-associated macrophages, specially the M2-type, promote tumor progression and drug resistance. The clinical outcome of patients with high neuron-specific enolase (NSE) expression is worse than that with low NSE expression. The tumor-promoting mechanism of NSE, however, remains unclear. This study explored the role of NSE in macrophage polarization associated with the immune microenvironment of DLBCL. Results: Our results showed that NSE protein expression was higher in lymphoma cell lines than in the B lymphocytes. Functional studies demonstrated that upregulation of NSE in lymphoma cells could promote M2 polarization and migration ability of macrophage, thereby consequently promoting the progression of lymphoma in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanism studies revealed that lymphoma-derived exosomes could mediate NSE into macrophages, NSE enhanced nuclear p50 translocation with subsequent defective classical nuclear factor-kappaB activity in macrophages. Conclusions: These results indicate that NSE may be a potential target for lymphoma therapy and a prognosis marker for lymphoma.|Cancer
ID:31192927|Title:Prolonged lumbosacral pain as the initial presentation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in an adult: A case report.Abstract:RATIONALE: The differential diagnosis of conditions manifesting as bone and joint pain is complex. Although many individuals with acute leukemia experience bone pain, lumbosacral pain as an early feature of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is rare. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we report a case of an adult who presented with a 7-month history of persistent lumbosacral pain which had become more severe during the previous month. DIAGNOSES: Prior to referral, his full blood count revealed no abnormalities, and a computerized tomography scan revealed mild bone hyperplasia of his lumbar vertebrae, with disc herniations of L3-S1. His blood biochemistry and urinary test results had been normal. After referral to our clinic, tests of the morphology, immunology, cytogenetics, and molecular biology of his bone marrow led to a diagnosis of MLL-AF4 fusion positive B-cell ALL. INTERVENTIONS: Prior to his referral, he had been treated with painkillers by local doctors. The painkillers initially provided pain relief, but their effect wore off over time. After diagnosis, he was started on an adult ALL chemotherapy protocol. OUTCOMES: His symptoms resolved within a week of starting chemotherapy. At his most recent assessment, 10 months after diagnosis, he was on maintenance chemotherapy and in remission. LESSONS: This case illustrates that prolonged lumbosacral pain may be a symptom of a life-threatening condition, rather than only attributable to chronic inflammation or disk herniations. Therefore, clinicians need to pay attention to subtle differences in the clinical presentation of patients with lumbosacral pain.|Cancer
ID:31193934|Title:MiR-193a regulates chemoresistance of human osteosarcoma cells via repression of IRS2.Abstract:Chemoresistance prevents curative potential of chemotherapy in most cases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key players in regulating chemoresistance in osteosarcoma, which is the most common primary bone cancer. Bisulfite sequencing and quantitative real time PCR analyses showed that miR-193a expression is downregulated by DNA hypermethylation at its promoter region in a chemoresistant cell line, SJSA-1, compared to a chemosensitive cell line G-292. Introduction of a miR-193a mimic in SJSA-1 cells or an antagomir into G-292 cells confirmed the role of miR-193a in osteosarcoma chemoresistance. Bioinformatics together with biochemical assays showed that insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) is a target of miR-193a. Our data concludes that miR-193a plays a role in the osteosarcoma chemoresistance and thus might serve as a useful biomarker for osteosarcoma prognosis.|Cancer
ID:31195689|Title:Preclinical Modelling of PDA: Is Organoid the New Black?Abstract:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a malignancy of the exocrine pancreas with the worst prognosis among all solid tumours, and soon to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease is crucial to the development of diagnostic tools as well as to the identification of more effective therapies. High-frequency mutations in PDA occur in "undruggable" genes, and molecular subtyping based on bulk transcriptome analysis does not yet nominate valid therapeutic intervention strategies. Genome-wide sequencing studies have also demonstrated a considerable intra- and inter-patient's genetic heterogeneity, which further complicate this dire scenario. More than in other malignancies, functionalization of the PDA genome and preclinical modelling at the individual patient level appear necessary to substantially improve survival rates for pancreatic cancer patients. Traditional human PDA models, including monolayer cell cultures and patient-derived xenografts, have certainly led to valuable biological insights in the past years. However, those model systems suffer from several limitations that have contributed to the lack of concordance between preclinical and clinical studies for PDA. Pancreatic ductal organoids have recently emerged as a reliable culture system to establish models from both normal and neoplastic pancreatic tissues. Pancreatic organoid cultures can be efficiently generated from small tissue biopsies, which opens up the possibility of longitudinal studies in individual patients. A proof-of-concept study has demonstrated that patient-derived PDA organoids are able to predict responses to conventional chemotherapy. The use of this three-dimensional culture system has already improved our understanding of PDA biology and promises to implement precision oncology by enabling the alignment of preclinical and clinical platforms to guide therapeutic intervention in PDA.|Cancer
ID:31195997|Title:Anti-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor GluR2 encephalitis in a myasthenia gravis patient with complete thymectomy: a case report.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a newly recognized autoimmune disorders in which the targets are proteins or receptors involved in synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) is a subtype of glutamate receptor that mediates most of the fast excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old woman presented with subacute onset of memory loss and behavioral changes. High levels of serum (1:1000) and CSF (1:32) antibodies against the AMPAR GluR2 were detected. A wide range of abnormalities in 6-8 Hz low to middle slow waves was found by electroencephalographs, and high-intensity signals on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery in both the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus were identified on brain magnetic resonance images. This patient presented with myasthenia gravis and type B2 thymoma (World Health Organization Thymoma Classification) at age 48. This case was unique in that the patient initiated with the symptom of myasthenia gravis and thymoma two years prior to encephalitis, and a complete thymectomy was performed before AE onset without recurrence of the thymoma when encephalitis occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Thymoma was reported to be associated with paraneoplastic neurological disease. This is the first time a thymectomy has been applied in a myasthenia gravis patient with thymoma two years prior to the onset of anti-AMPAR2 encephalitis. This case highlights the complexity of autoimmune encephalitis associated with thymoma.|Cancer
ID:31197228|Title:Role of the DNA damage response in prostate cancer formation, progression and treatment.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Clinical and preclinical studies have revealed that alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) pathways may play an important role in prostate cancer (PCa) etiology and progression. These alterations can influence PCa responses to radiotherapy and anti-androgen treatment. The identification of DNA repair gene aberrations in PCa has driven the interest for further evaluation whether these genetic changes may serve as biomarkers for patient stratification. METHODS: In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on DDR alterations in PCa, their potential impact on clinical interventions and prospects for improved management of PCa. We particularly focus on the influence of DDR gene mutations on PCa initiation and progression and describe the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of these mechanisms, will contribute to better disease management as treatment strategies can be chosen based on the specific disease properties, since a growing number of treatments are targeting DDR pathway alterations (such as Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors). Furthermore, the recently discovered crosstalk between the DDR and androgen receptor signaling opens a new array of possible strategies to optimize treatment combinations. We discuss how these recent and ongoing studies will help to improve diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches for PCa management.|Cancer
ID:31199507|Title:Temporal and spatial effects and survival outcomes associated with concordance between tissue and blood KRAS alterations in the pan-cancer setting.Abstract:We investigated the impact of time interval, primary vs. metastatic biopsy site, variant allele fraction (VAF) and histology on concordance of KRAS alterations in tissue vs. circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and association of concordance with survival. Blood and tissue were evaluated by next-generation sequencing in 433 patients with diverse cancers. Altogether, 101 patients (23.3%) had KRAS alterations: 56, ctDNA (12.9%); 81, tissue (18.7%); and 36, both (8.3%). The overall blood and tissue concordance rate for KRAS alterations was 85%, but was mainly driven by the large negative/negative subset. Therefore, specificity of one test for the other was high (88.1-94.3%), while sensitivity was not high (44.4-64.3%) and was lower still in patients with >6 vs. <=2 months between blood and tissue sampling (31.0-40.9% vs. 51.2-84.0%; p = 0.14 time interval-dependent sensitivity of blood for tissue; p = 0.003, tissue for blood). Positive concordance rate for KRAS alterations was 57.1% vs. 27.4% (colorectal vs. noncolorectal cancer; p = 0.01), but site of biopsy (primary vs. metastatic) and VAF (%ctDNA) was not impactful. The presence of KRAS alterations in both tests was independently associated with shorter survival from diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.86) and from recurrent/metastatic disease (1.70; 1.03-2.81). Positive concordance of KRAS alterations between ctDNA and tissue was negatively affected by a longer time period between blood and tissue sampling and was higher in colorectal cancer than in other malignancies. The presence of KRAS alterations in both tests was an independent prognostic factor for poor survival.|Cancer

ID:31203467|Title:The Role of Circulating Tumor DNA in Lung Cancer: Mutational Analysis, Diagnosis, and Surveillance Now and into the Future.Abstract:OPINION STATEMENT: Isolation and analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have emerged as an effective and promising tool for genomic profiling in non-small cell lung cancer. Analysis of ctDNA can be particularly useful in situations where tissue biopsy is not safely obtainable due to poor physical condition or inaccessible tumor biopsy location. In addition to identifying oncogenic driver mutations which can be treated with targetable therapy in the treatment naive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) setting, ctDNA is being utilized in novel ways including monitoring during an advanced NSCLC patient's treatment course (real-time monitoring), determining mechanisms of resistance and, lastly, as a tool to identify minimal residual disease in early-stage NSCLC. Recent research demonstrates that ctDNA testing can provide a useful adjunct to tissue genotyping in NSCLC. Utilization of ctDNA into routine clinical practice for NSCLC should be strongly considered.|Cancer

METHODS: The clinic data of 19 adult ALL patients with t (1; 19) (E2A-PBX1) in our hospital from Nov. 22, 2010 to Apr. 4, 2018 were collected. The clinical features,complete remission (CR) rate, overall survival (OS) rate and relapse-free survival (RFS) rate of patients received chemotherapy and chemotherapy+HSCT were analyzed. RESULTS: In all the 19 patients, the median age was 24 (14-66), median WBC count was 16.47x109 (1.8-170.34)/L, median Hb level was 98 (65-176) g/L, median Plt count was 50 (15-254)x109/L. Pre B-ALL were 17 cases (89.5%), and common B-ALL were 2 cases (10.5%). Patients received the induction therapy, the overall CR rate was 94.7%, one course CR rate was 94.7%, 4 year OS rate was 47.1% and RFS rate was 43.3%. The OS rate and RFS rate of patients received transplantation were slightly higher than those of patients not received transplantation (OS: 62.5% vs 36.7%) (P=0.188);RFS (62.5% vs 38.9%) (P=0.166). CONCLUSION: Most adult ALL patients with t (1; 19) (E2A-PBX1) is Pre B-ALL by Immunophenotyping, as compared with the pediatric patients, the therapeutic efficacy for adult patients with t (1; 19) (E2A-PBX1) is worsen, therefore, stem cell transplantation is still acquired for better long term survival.|Cancer
ID:31207705|Title:[Analysis of induction efficacy and prognostic factors in FLT3-ITD positive acute myeloid leukemia in the real world].Abstract:Objective: To investigate the efficacy and prognostic factors of induction therapy in FLT3-ITD(+) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the real world data. Methods: From January 2013 to December 2016, 114 de novo patients with FLT3-ITD(+)AML were enrolled in this study. Out of 114 cases, 75 were male, and 39 were female. The median age was 42 years old (ranged from 14 to 72 years old) . The chemotherapy regimens were used for induction therapy and all cases were followed up. The treatment response was evaluated by MICM and the comparison of the ratio were analyzed by chi-square test and the survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. Results: There were 52 FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients with favorable prognosis genes (46 cases with NPM1, 5 cases with RUNX1-RUNX1T1, 1 case with CEBPA double mutation) and 62 patients with other types of FLT3-ITD(+)AML at diagnosis. All patients completed at least one cycle of induction therapy and the clinical curative effect was evaluated, complete remission (CR) rate was 50.0% (57/114) in one cycle and total CR rate was 72.5% (74/104) in two cycles. The CR rate of the FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients with favorable prognosis genes was 67.3% (35/52) in one cycle and 83.3% (40/48) in two cycles; for the other types FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients, the CR rate was 35.5% (22/62) in one cycle and 64.8% (35/54) in two cycles. There was a significant difference in CR rate between the FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients with and without favorable prognosis genes (P<0.05) . This indicates that the FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients with favorable prognosis gene had relatively good therapeutic effect. Among other types of FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients who did not achieve remission from one cycle of chemotherapy, 9 patients were given sorafenib plus chemotherapy and 6 cases (66.7%) achieved CR; 23 patients were given conventional chemotherapy and 7 cases (30.4%) achieved CR. There was a significant difference between sorafenib plus chemotherapy and conventional chemotherapy groups (chi(2)=4.47, P<0.05) and this indicates that sorafenib plus chemotherapy can significantly improve the CR rate of FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients. Comparing overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) , there was no significant difference between sorafenib plus chemotherapy and conventional chemotherapy groups (P values were 0.641 and 0.517, respectively) . Conclusion: The overall prognosis of FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients is poor, and the stratification therapeutic efficacy of FLT3-ITD(+)AML without favorable prognosis gene can be improved by sorafenib combined with chemotherapy.|Cancer
ID:31208361|Title:Molecular genetic characterization reveals linear tumor evolution in a pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas patient with a novel PHF20-NTRK1 fusion: a case report.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (SC) consists of both carcinomatous and sarcomatous tumors with high degree of malignancy, rapid progression, and poor prognosis. However, little is known regarding how pulmonary SC develops and progresses. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old male was initially diagnosed with stage IIIa lung cancer containing both adenocarcinoma (ADC) and SC. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administrated post-surgery, however, recurrence with SC only soon followed. Mutation profiling of the patient's microdissected ADC and SC components of the primary lesion and recurrent tumor was performed by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 416 cancer-relevant genes. Our data showed that primary SC/ADC and the recurrent SC shared multiple gene mutations including EGFR, NF1, TP53, CDKN2B, and SMARCA4, while both primary and recurrent SCs had a unique TP53 exon 4 splicing mutation frequently observed in sarcoma. Interestingly, a novel PHF20-NTRK1 fusion was acquired in the recurrent SC, which may be a potential driver for SC recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular genetic characteristics of tumor tissues at different stages reveals a linear tumor evolution model in this case, and support that the primary SC derived from the original lung ADC during the evolution of the tumor. We also identified a novel PHF20-NTRK1 fusion, which may contribute to the disease recurrence, and that can be potentially targeted with NTRK1 inhibitors for treatment.|Cancer
ID:31208696|Title:Epigenome Remodeling in Cholangiocarcinoma.Abstract:Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) comprises a heterogeneous collection of malignancies arising within the biliary tract, characterized by late diagnosis, innate chemoresistance, and abysmal prognosis. Sequencing data have uncovered recurrent mutations in diverse epigenetic regulators, implicating epigenetic destabilization at the root of these tumors. However, few studies have characterized biliary tumor epigenomes. In this Opinion article, we argue that an epigenome-oriented approach to CCA could establish diverse interconnections between many key aspects of research on this disease, including molecular heterogeneity, diverse cells of origin, and prominent tumor microenvironments. Moreover, we discuss plausible causes of epigenome dysregulation in biliary tumors, including genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, microenvironmental, and physiological factors. Lastly, we assess the translational potential of epigenomics in CCA to uncover robust biomarkers and therapeutic opportunities for this growing group of patients with limited treatment options.|Cancer
ID:31209238|Title:Community assessment to advance computational prediction of cancer drug combinations in a pharmacogenomic screen.Abstract:The effectiveness of most cancer targeted therapies is short-lived. Tumors often develop resistance that might be overcome with drug combinations. However, the number of possible combinations is vast, necessitating data-driven approaches to find optimal patient-specific treatments. Here we report AstraZeneca's large drug combination dataset, consisting of 11,576 experiments from 910 combinations across 85 molecularly characterized cancer cell lines, and results of a DREAM Challenge to evaluate computational strategies for predicting synergistic drug pairs and biomarkers. 160 teams participated to provide a comprehensive methodological development and benchmarking. Winning methods incorporate prior knowledge of drug-target interactions. Synergy is predicted with an accuracy matching biological replicates for >60% of combinations. However, 20% of drug combinations are poorly predicted by all methods. Genomic rationale for synergy predictions are identified, including ADAM17 inhibitor antagonism when combined with PIK3CB/D inhibition contrasting to synergy when combined with other PI3K-pathway inhibitors in PIK3CA mutant cells.|Cancer

METHODS: A total of 5 000 pieces of prostate cancer magnetic resonance (MR) imaging discovery sets with manual annotations were used to train a modified U-net, and a set of clinically demand-oriented, stable and efficient full convolutional neural network algorithm was constructed. The MR images were cropped and segmented automatically by using modified U-net, and the segmentation data were automatically reconstructed using MITK platform according to our own protocols. The modeling data were output as STL format, and the prostate models were simultaneously displayed on an android tablet during the operation to help achieving cognitive navigation. RESULTS: Based on original U-net architecture, we established a modified U-net from a 201-case MR imaging training set. The network performance was tested and compared with human segmentations and other segmentation networks by using one certain testing data set. Auto segmentation of multi-structures (such as prostate, prostate tumors, seminal vesicles, rectus, neurovascular bundles and dorsal venous complex) were successfully achieved. Secondary automatic 3D reconstruction had been carried out through MITK platform. During the surgery, 3D models of prostatic area were simultaneously displayed on an android tablet, and the cognitive navigation was successfully achieved. Intra-operation organ visualization demonstrated the structural relationships among the key structures in great detail and the degree of tumor invasion was visualized directly. CONCLUSION: The modified U-net was able to achieve automatic segmentations of important structures of prostate area. Secondary 3D model reconstruction and demonstration could provide intraoperative visualization of vital structures of prostate area, which could help achieve cognitive fusion navigation for surgeons. The application of these techniques could finally reduce positive surgical margin rates, and may improve the efficacy and oncological outcomes of laparoscopic prostatectomy.|Cancer
ID:31209635|Title:Recent advances in invasive adenocarcinoma of the cervix.Abstract:Endocervical adenocarcinomas (ECAs) are currently classified according to the 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) system, which is predominantly based on descriptive morphologic characteristics, considers factors bearing minimal etiological, clinical, or therapeutic relevance, and lacks sufficient reproducibility. The 2017 International Endocervical Adenocarcinoma Criteria and Classification (IECC) system was developed by a group of international collaborators to address these limitations. The IECC system separates ECAs into two major groups-those that are human papillomavirus-associated (HPVA) and those that are non-HPV-associated (NHPVA)-based on morphology (linked to etiology) alone, precluding the need for an expensive panel of immunohistochemical markers for most cases. The major types of HPVA ECA include the usual (with villoglandular and micropapillary architectural variants) and mucinous types (not otherwise specified [NOS], intestinal, signet-ring, and invasive stratified mucin-producing carcinoma). Invasive adenocarcinoma NOS is morphologically uninformative, yet considered part of this group when HPV positive. NHPVA ECAs include gastric, clear cell, endometrioid, and mesonephric types. The IECC system is supported by demographic and clinical features (HPVA ECAs develop in younger patients, are smaller, and are diagnosed at an earlier stage), p16/HPV status (almost all HPVA ECAs are p16 and/or HPV positive), prognostic parameters (NHPVA ECAs more often have lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastases, and are Silva pattern C), and survival data (NHPVA ECAs are associated with worse survival). A move from the morphology-based WHO system to the IECC system will likely provide clinicians with an improved means to diagnose and classify ECAs, and ultimately, to better personalize treatment for these patients.|Cancer
ID:31212132|Title:Identification of a novel orally bioavailable ERK5 inhibitor with selectivity over p38alpha and BRD4.Abstract:Extracellular regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) signalling has been implicated in driving a number of cellular phenotypes including endothelial cell angiogenesis and tumour cell motility. Novel ERK5 inhibitors were identified using high throughput screening, with a series of pyrrole-2-carboxamides substituted at the 4-position with an aroyl group being found to exhibit IC50 values in the micromolar range, but having no selectivity against p38alpha MAP kinase. Truncation of the N-substituent marginally enhanced potency (~3-fold) against ERK5, but importantly attenuated inhibition of p38alpha. Systematic variation of the substituents on the aroyl group led to the selective inhibitor 4-(2-bromo-6-fluorobenzoyl)-N-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxamide (IC50 0.82 muM for ERK5; IC50 > 120 muM for p38alpha). The crystal structure (PDB 5O7I) of this compound in complex with ERK5 has been solved. This compound was orally bioavailable and inhibited bFGF-driven Matrigel plug angiogenesis and tumour xenograft growth. The selective ERK5 inhibitor described herein provides a lead for further development into a tool compound for more extensive studies seeking to examine the role of ERK5 signalling in cancer and other diseases.|Cancer
ID:31212602|Title:Bioinformatics Analysis for Circulating Cell-Free DNA in Cancer.Abstract:Molecular analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that circulates in plasma and other body fluids represents a "liquid biopsy" approach for non-invasive cancer screening or monitoring. The rapid development of sequencing technologies has made cfDNA a promising source to study cancer development and progression. Specific genetic and epigenetic alterations have been found in plasma, serum, and urine cfDNA and could potentially be used as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in various cancer types. In this review, we will discuss the molecular characteristics of cancer cfDNA and major bioinformatics approaches involved in the analysis of cfDNA sequencing data for detecting genetic mutation, copy number alteration, methylation change, and nucleosome positioning variation. We highlight specific challenges in sensitivity to detect genetic aberrations and robustness of statistical analysis. Finally, we provide perspectives regarding the standard and continuing development of bioinformatics analysis to move this promising screening tool into clinical practice.|Cancer
ID:31212687|Title:Optimizing Genetic Workup in Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma by Integrating Diagnostic and Research Approaches.Abstract:Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) are rare neuroendocrine tumors with a strong hereditary background and a large genetic heterogeneity. Identification of the underlying genetic cause is crucial for the management of patients and their families as it aids differentiation between hereditary and sporadic cases. To improve diagnostics and clinical management we tailored an enrichment based comprehensive multi-gene next generation sequencing panel applicable to both analyses of tumor tissue and blood samples. We applied this panel to tumor samples and compared its performance to our current routine diagnostic approach. Routine diagnostic sequencing of 11 PPGL susceptibility genes was applied to blood samples of 65 unselected PPGL patients at a single center in Dresden, Germany. Predisposing germline mutations were identified in 19 (29.2%) patients. Analyses of 28 PPGL tumor tissues using the dedicated PPGL panel revealed pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in known PPGL susceptibility genes in 21 (75%) cases, including mutations in IDH2, ATRX and HRAS. These mutations suggest sporadic tumor development. Our results imply a diagnostic benefit from extended molecular tumor testing of PPGLs and consequent improvement of patient management. The approach is promising for determination of prognostic biomarkers that support therapeutic decision-making.|Cancer
ID:31212691|Title:Stabilization of Intrinsically Disordered DKK2 Protein by Fusion to RNA-Binding Domain.Abstract:Intrinsic disorders are a common feature of hub proteins in eukaryotic interactomes controlling the signaling pathways. The intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are prone to misfolding, and maintaining their functional stability remains a major challenge in validating their therapeutic potentials. Considering that IDPs are highly enriched in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), here we reasoned and confirmed that IDPs could be stabilized by fusion to RBPs. Dickkopf2 (DKK2), Wnt antagonist and a prototype IDP, was fused with lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), with or without the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of an immunoglobulin and expressed predominantly as a soluble form from a bacterial host. The functional competence was confirmed by in vitro Wnt signaling reporter and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in vivo Matrigel plug assay. The removal of LysRS by site-specific protease cleavage prompted the insoluble aggregation, confirming that the linkage to RBP chaperones the functional competence of IDPs. While addressing to DKK2 as a key modulator for cancer and ischemic vascular diseases, our results suggest the use of RBPs as stabilizers of disordered proteinaceous materials for acquiring and maintaining the structural stability and functional competence, which would impact the druggability of a variety of IDPs from human proteome.|Cancer
ID:31215094|Title:Roles of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and pentose phosphate pathway in bile acid-induced cancer development.Abstract:Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) as well as adenocarcinomas (EACs) were developed in rat duodenal contents reflux models (reflux model). The present study aimed to shed light on the mechanism by which bile acid stimulation causes cancer onset and progression. Metabolomics analyses were performed on samples of neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissues from reflux models, and K14D, cultivated from a nonmetastatic, primary ESCC, and ESCC-DR, established from a metastatic thoracic lesion. ESCC-DRtca2M was prepared by treating ESCC-DR cells with taurocholic acid (TCA) to accelerate cancer progression. The lines were subjected to comprehensive genomic analyses. In addition, protein expression levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) (p65) and O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) were compared among lines. Cancers developed in the reflux models exhibited greater hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) activation compared with the nonneoplastic tissues. Expression of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) increased considerably in both ESCC and EAC compared with nonneoplastic squamous epithelium. Conversely, cell line-based experiments revealed the greater activation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) at higher degrees of malignancy. G6PD overexpression in response to TCA exposure was observed. Both NF-kappaB (p65) and O-GlcNAc were expressed more highly in ESCC-DRtca2M than in the other cell lines. Moreover, ESCC-DRtca2M cells had additional chromosomal abnormalities in excess of ESCC-DR cells. Overall, glucose metabolism was upregulated in both esophageal cancer tissue and cell lines. While bile acids are not mutagenic, chronic exposure seems to trigger NF-kappaB(p65) activation, potentially inducing genetic mutations as well as facilitating carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Glucose metabolism was upregulated in both esophageal cancer tissue and cell lines, and the HBP was activated in the former. The cell line-based experiments demonstrated upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) at higher degrees of malignancy. While bile acids are not mutagenic, chronic exposure seems to trigger G6PD overexpression and NF-kappaB (p65) activation, potentially inducing genetic mutations as well as facilitating carcinogenesis and cancer progression.|Cancer
ID:31215130|Title:Vocal cord inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor with mucoid deposits harboring TIMP3-ALK fusion: A potential diagnostic pitfall.Abstract:A 35-year-old Japanese man who had experienced hoarseness for 10 years presented with a vocal cord lesion. A gross examination revealed a left vocal cord polyp occupying two-thirds of the vocal space. The endoscopically resected lesion contained scattered atypical fibroblastic, stellate, or ganglion-like cells with mucoid stroma. Vacuolated cells were also seen. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate was largely undetectable. A vocal cord polyp was first suspected, but well-differentiated liposarcoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) were included in the differential diagnoses. The tumor cells were positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), calponin, and vimentin, and negative for other smooth muscle markers by immunohistochemistry. Structures resembling myofibroblasts were not observed by electron microscopy, which confirmed abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum in the tumor cells and accumulated lipid droplets in some tumor cells. ALK gene rearrangement was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and TIMP3-ALK fusion was confirmed by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. We diagnosed the lesion as an IMT, and an ALK-rearranged stellate cell tumor may be postulated. This is the first report of a fusion partner gene of ALK in a case of laryngeal IMT.|Cancer
ID:31216696|Title:Multidisciplinary Challenges in Mastocytosis and How to Address with Personalized Medicine Approaches.Abstract:Mastocytosis is a hematopoietic neoplasm defined by abnormal expansion and focal accumulation of clonal tissue mast cells in various organ-systems. The disease exhibits a complex pathology and an equally complex clinical behavior. The classification of the World Health Organization (WHO) divides mastocytosis into cutaneous forms, systemic variants, and localized mast cell tumors. In >80% of patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM), a somatic point mutation in KIT at codon 816 is found. Whereas patients with indolent forms of the disease have a normal or near-normal life expectancy, patients with advanced mast cell neoplasms, including aggressive SM and mast cell leukemia, have a poor prognosis with short survival times. In a majority of these patients, multiple somatic mutations and/or an associated hematologic neoplasm, such as a myeloid leukemia, may be detected. Independent of the category of mastocytosis and the serum tryptase level, patients may suffer from mediator-related symptoms and/or osteopathy. Depending on the presence of co-morbidities, the symptomatology in such patients may be mild, severe or even life-threatening. Most relevant co-morbidities in such patients are IgE-dependent allergies, psychiatric, psychological or mental problems, and vitamin D deficiency. The diagnosis and management of mastocytosis is an emerging challenge in clinical practice and requires vast knowledge, a multidisciplinary approach, and personalized medicine procedures. In this article, the current knowledge about mastocytosis is reviewed with special emphasis on the multidisciplinary aspects of the disease and related challenges in daily practice.|Cancer
ID:31216739|Title:PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome: A Clinical Overview.Abstract:The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) is a grouping of related genetic disorders that has been linked to germline mutations in the PTEN gene. These disorders include Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, adult Lhermitte-Duclos disease, and autism spectrum disorders associated with macrocephaly. The majority of the clinical information available on PHTS, however, is related to individuals diagnosed with CS. There is still much to be learned about this disorder, since diagnostic criteria for CS were only established in 1996, before the identification of the PTEN gene, and were based primarily on features seen in cases reported in the existing literature. More recently, however, data from several large series of patients have shown that a number of the clinical features associated with PTEN mutations are either more or less common than previously reported. In addition, we now know that only about 30-35% of patients meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome actually have a detectable PTEN mutation. Thus, our understanding of PTEN-related diseases and their management has evolved significantly over time. The United States National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has produced and regularly updates practice guidelines which include clinical diagnostic criteria as well as guidelines for PTEN testing and management of patients with mutations. This review will summarize the overall literature on PHTS as well as recent findings which are broadening our understanding of this set of disorders.|Cancer
ID:31216832|Title:[Clinicopathological characteristics and differential diagnosis of interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma].Abstract:Objective: To analyze the clinicopathological features and differential diagnosis of interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma (IDCS). Methods: The clinical pathological features of 7 IDCS were analyzed. Among them, the follow-up results of 6 cases were available. Results: Among the 7 IDCS patients, 4 cases were male and 3 were female. The age of the patients ranged from 26 to 69 years.Three cases were originated from lymph nodes and 4 cases were originated from skin, stomach, adrenal gland and mesentery, respectively. Microscopically, the tumor cells presented as fascicular and storiform proliferation and infiltrated by lymphocytes. The tumor cells were short-spindle or ovoid, with indistinct border of cytoplasm. The immunohistochemistry results showed that tumor cells were S-100, Vim, CD68 and CD163 positive, and AE1/AE3, EMA, CD117, CD34, Desmin, SMA, CD1alpha, CD21, CD23, CD35, HMB45, Melan-A, MelanPan and ALK negative.The BRAF mutation and clonal rearrangement of T and B cells were not detected. Among the follow-up period of 7 IDCS patients, 3 occurred disease progressions. Conclusions: IDCS is extremely rare with unique pathological features, and its lesion is not limited to the lymph node. The IDCS patients with extensive lesions may have worse prognose. The differential diagnosis of IDCS includes other histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms, malignant melanoma and soft tissue neoplasms.|Cancer
ID:31217437|Title:Adenoviral vaccine targeting multiple neoantigens as strategy to eradicate large tumors combined with checkpoint blockade.Abstract:Neoantigens (nAgs) are promising tumor antigens for cancer vaccination with the potential of inducing robust and selective T cell responses. Genetic vaccines based on Adenoviruses derived from non-human Great Apes (GAd) elicit strong and effective T cell-mediated immunity in humans. Here, we investigate for the first time the potency and efficacy of a novel GAd encoding multiple neoantigens. Prophylactic or early therapeutic vaccination with GAd efficiently control tumor growth in mice. In contrast, combination of the vaccine with checkpoint inhibitors is required to eradicate large tumors. Gene expression profile of tumors in regression shows abundance of activated tumor infiltrating T cells with a more diversified TCR repertoire in animals treated with GAd and anti-PD1 compared to anti-PD1. Data suggest that effectiveness of vaccination in the presence of high tumor burden correlates with the breadth of nAgs-specific T cells and requires concomitant reversal of tumor suppression by checkpoint blockade.|Cancer
ID:31220302|Title:Prognostic Significance of CHEK2 Mutation in Progression of Breast Cancer.Abstract:Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women; genetic mutations reflect the development of this disease. Mutations in cell signaling factors can be the main cause of BC development. In this study, we focused on mutations in checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) and their impact as a prognostic factor in the pathogenesis of BC. CHEK2 is controlled in cell signaling pathways through the influence of upstream genes. Also, several downstream genes are regulated by CHEK2. In addition, mutations in CHEK2 lead to resistance of BC cells to chemotherapy and metastasis of cancer cells to other parts of the body. Finally, detection of mutations in CHEK2 can be used as a prognostic factor for patient response to treatment and for targeting downstream molecules of CHEK2 that are involved in the proliferation of breast tumor cells. Mutations such as c.1100delC and I157T can distinguish which patients are susceptible to metastasis.|Cancer
ID:31220642|Title:Clinical and Pathological Characterization of Lynch-Like Syndrome.Abstract:BACKGROUND & AIMS: Lynch syndrome is characterized by DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency. Some patients with suspected Lynch syndrome have DNA MMR deficiencies but no detectable mutations in genes that encode MMR proteins-this is called Lynch-like syndrome (LLS). There is no consensus on management of patients with LLS. We collected data from a large series of patients with LLS to identify clinical and pathology features. METHODS: We collected data from a nationwide-registry of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) in Spain. We identified patients whose colorectal tumors had loss of MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, or MLH1 (based on immunohistochemistry), without the mutation encoding V600E in BRAF (detected by real-time PCR), and/or no methylation at MLH1 (determined by methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification), and no pathogenic mutations in MMR genes, BRAF, or EPCAM (determined by DNA sequencing). These patients were considered to have LLS. We collected data on demographic, clinical, and pathology features and family history of neoplasms. The chi2 test was used to analyze the association between qualitative variables, followed by the Fisher exact test and the Student t test or the Mann-Whitney test for quantitative variables. RESULTS: We identified 160 patients with LLS; their mean age at diagnosis of CRC was 55 years and 66 patients were female (41%). The Amsterdam I and II criteria for Lynch syndrome were fulfilled by 11% of cases and the revised Bethesda guideline criteria by 65% of cases. Of the patients with LLS, 24% were identified in universal screening. There were no proportional differences in sex, indication for colonoscopy, immunohistochemistry, pathology findings, or personal history of CRC or other Lynch syndrome-related tumors between patients who met the Amsterdam and/or Bethesda criteria for Lynch syndrome and patients identified in universal screening for Lynch syndrome, without a family history of CRC. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LLS have homogeneous clinical, demographic, and pathology characteristics, regardless of family history of CRC.|Cancer
ID:31221662|Title:Mutation Status of RAS, TP53, and SMAD4 is Superior to Mutation Status of RAS Alone for Predicting Prognosis after Resection of Colorectal Liver Metastases.Abstract:PURPOSE: Somatic gene mutations have been increasingly recognized to impact prognosis following resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM). We aimed to determine the impact of combinations of somatic mutations on survival in patients undergoing CLM resection. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We identified patients who underwent initial CLM resection during 2007-2017 and had genetic sequencing data available. Risk factors for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were determined using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Of 1460 patients who underwent CLM resection during the study period, 507 met the inclusion criteria. Multigene testing revealed mutation rates greater than 10% for TP53 (mutated in 70.8% of patients), APC (53.5%), RAS (50.7%), PIK3CA (15.8%), and SMAD4 (11.0%). BRAF was mutated in 2.0% of patients. BRAF, RAS, TP53, and SMAD4 mutations were significantly associated with OS, and RAS, TP53, and SMAD4 mutations were significantly associated with RFS. Coexisting mutations in RAS, TP53, and SMAD4 were associated with significantly worse OS and RFS than coexisting mutations in any 2 of these genes and mutations in 1 or none of these genes. Coexisting mutations in 2 genes conferred significantly worse OS and RFS than single mutation or no mutations. OS and RFS did not differ significantly between patients with RAS mutation and wild-type TP53 and SMAD4 and patients with wild-type RAS (P = 0.858 and 0.729, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: RAS mutation status alone is not sufficient for precisely predicting prognosis after CLM resection.|Cancer
ID:31230400|Title:Mutational profiling of poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma by the use of targeted next-generation sequencing.Abstract:AIMS: To characterise the mutational profiles of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) and to identify markers with potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic significance. METHODS AND RESULTS: Targeted next-generation sequencing with a panel of 18 thyroid carcinoma-related genes was performed on tissue samples from 41 PDTC and 25 ATC patients. Genetic alterations and their correlations with clinicopathological factors, including survival outcomes, were also analysed. Our results showed that ATC had significantly higher mutation rates of BRAF, TP53, TERT and PIK3CA than PDTC (P = 0.005, P = 0.007, P = 0.005, and P = 0.033, respectively). Nine (69%) ATC cases with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) components harboured BRAF mutations, all of which coexisted with a late mutation event (TP53, TERT, or PIK3CA). Nine cases with oncogenic fusion (six RET cases, one NTRK1 case, one ALK case, and one PPARG case) were identified in 41 PDTCs, whereas only one case with oncogenic fusion (NTRK1) was found among 25 ATCs. Moreover, all six cases of RET fusion were found in PDTC with PTC components, accounting for 33%. In PDTC/ATC patients, concurrent TERT and PIK3CA mutations were associated with poor overall survival after adjustment for TNM stage (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ATC with PTC components is typically characterised by a BRAF mutation with a late mutation event, whereas PDTC with PTC components is more closely correlated with RET fusion. TERT and concurrent PIK3CA mutations predict worse overall survival in PDTC/ATC patients.|Cancer
ID:31231679|Title:SETER/PR: a robust 18-gene predictor for sensitivity to endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer.Abstract:There is a clinical need to predict sensitivity of metastatic hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer to endocrine therapy, and targeted RNA sequencing (RNAseq) offers diagnostic potential to measure both transcriptional activity and functional mutation. We developed the SETER/PR index to measure gene expression microarray probe sets that were correlated with hormone receptors (ESR1 and PGR) and robust to preanalytical and analytical influences. We tested SETER/PR index in biopsies of metastastic HR+/HER2- breast cancer against the treatment outcomes in 140 patients. Then we customized the SETER/PR assay to measure 18 informative, 10 reference transcripts, and sequence the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ESR1 using droplet-based targeted RNAseq, and tested that in residual RNA from 53 patients. Higher SETER/PR index in metastatic samples predicted longer PFS and OS when patients received endocrine therapy as next treatment, even after adjustment for clinical-pathologic risk factors (PFS: HR 0.534, 95% CI 0.299 to 0.955, p = 0.035; OS: HR 0.315, 95% CI 0.157 to 0.631, p = 0.001). Mutated ESR1 LBD was detected in 8/53 (15%) of metastases, involving 1-98% of ESR1 transcripts (all had high SETER/PR index). A signature based on probe sets with good preanalytical and analytical performance facilitated our customization of an accurate targeted RNAseq assay to measure both phenotype and genotype of ER-related transcription. Elevated SETER/PR was associated with prolonged sensitivity to endocrine therapy in patients with metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer, especially in the absence of mutated ESR1 transcript.|Cancer
ID:31234577|Title:Genome-Wide Analysis of Long Non-Coding RNA Profiles in Canine Oral Melanomas.Abstract:Mucosal melanomas (MM) are rare aggressive cancers in humans, and one of the most common forms of oral cancers in dogs. Similar biological and histological features are shared between MM in both species, making dogs a powerful model for comparative oncology studies of melanomas. Although exome sequencing recently identified recurrent coding mutations in canine MM, little is known about changes in non-coding gene expression, and more particularly, in canine long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are commonly dysregulated in human cancers. Here, we sampled a large cohort (n = 52) of canine normal/tumor oral MM from three predisposed breeds (poodles, Labrador retrievers, and golden retrievers), and used deep transcriptome sequencing to identify more than 400 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs. We further prioritized candidate lncRNAs by comparative genomic analysis to pinpoint 26 dog-human conserved DE lncRNAs, including SOX21-AS, ZEB2-AS, and CASC15 lncRNAs. Using unsupervised co-expression network analysis with coding genes, we inferred the potential functions of the DE lncRNAs, suggesting associations with cancer-related genes, cell cycle, and carbohydrate metabolism Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Finally, we exploited our multi-breed design to identify DE lncRNAs within breeds. This study provides a unique transcriptomic resource for studying oral melanoma in dogs, and highlights lncRNAs that may potentially be diagnostic or therapeutic targets for human and veterinary medicine.|Cancer
ID:31239713|Title:Androgen upregulates the palmitoylation of eIF3L in human prostate LNCaP cells.Abstract:Background: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. Most patients diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer can be treated with the main treatment: androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis plays a pivotal role in the progression of prostate cancer. However, most patients can ultimately progress to the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stage within 2 years. At this stage, drugs targeting the AR signaling axis, including enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate, cannot prevent the progression of prostate cancer, thus predicting a poor prognosis. The molecular mechanism lies in the aberrant AR reactivation, which exhibits an adaptive response to ADT, such as the presence of AR splice variants. Thus, CRPC treatment remains a challenge. Purpose: In addition to the AR axis, a mechanism leading to this progression should be determined. The present study mainly compared palmitoylated proteins between androgen-treated LNCaP cells and non-treated LNCaP cells by palmitoylome profiling, to illustrate the changes at proteomic levels. Materials and methods: To screen the androgen-induced palmitoylated proteins, we conducted proteomic experiments using clickable palmitate probe (Alk-C16) between three individual pairs of androgen-treated and non-treated LNCaP cells. Results: We identified 4351 unique peptides corresponding to 835 proteins, among them a number of these identified proteins were palmitoylated proteins, particularly eIF3L. Androgen treatment significantly increased the palmitoylation level of eIF3L, an individual subunit of eIF3. As an initiation factor, eIF3L plays a pivotal role in the translation of mRNAs encoding growth-promoting proteins by enhancing translation rates, thus controlling cell proliferation. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated that the regulation of eIF3L palmitoylation may provide new directions for the therapy of prostate cancer. Moreover, the increased level of androgen-induced eIF3L may be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of early-stage prostate cancer.|Cancer
ID:31239718|Title:Ilex hainanensis Merr targets ITGAV to suppress the proliferation and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells.Abstract:Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumor. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify effective and safe therapeutic agents against OS. It has been reported that Ilex hainanensis Merr (IME) possesses antitumor properties. Integrin subunit alpha V (ITGAV) is important for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of tumors. Purpose: The objective of this study was to whether IME can play a role in the treatment of osteosarcoma by regulating ITGAV. Methods: Western blot and real-time PCR were used to detect the expression of ITGAV in non-tumorous tissues, osteosarcoma tissues, and metastatic tumors. The expression of ITGAV in MG63, U2OS, and hFOB1. A total of 19 cells was determined through Western blotting and real-time PCR. The expression of ITGAV in OS cells treated with different concentrations of DDP was determined through Western blotting. Agter transfecting with control or si-ITGAV, and subsequently treated with control or 5 mumol/L DDP, MTT assay and transwell assay were used to detect the proliferaion and migration of cells. Western blot was used to detect the expression of ITGAV in cells treated with different concentrations of IME and MTT assay and transwell assay were used to detect the proliferaion and migration of cells. MG63 and U2OS cells were treated with control, 5 mumol/L DDP, 25 mumol/L IME, or 5 mumol/L DDP combined with 25 mumol/L IME, the expression of ITGAV was determined through Western blotting and real-time PCR. MTT assay and transwell assay were used to detect the proliferation and migration of cells. Inhibitory effect of IME on lung metastasis of osteosarcoma in vivo. Results: ITGAV was highly expressed in tumors, with the highest expression found in metastatic tumors and higher in OS cells. A low concentration of DDP (5 mumol/L) inhibited the expression of ITGAV. However, ITGAV may be related to the development of resistance to DDP. Silencing of ITGAV downregulates the proliferation and migration of OS cells as the effect of low-concentration DDP (5 mumol/L). IME inhibited the proliferation and migration of MG63 and U2OS cells in a concentration-dependent manner and decreased the expression of ITGAV. MTT and Transwell assays showed that 25 mumol/L IME and 5 mumol/L DDP exhibited similar inhibitory effects on the proliferation and migration of OS cells. The combination of IME with DDP resulted in the amplification of these inhibitory effects. Both DDP and IME downregulated the expression of ITGAV, and the inhibition of ITGAV was amplified by the combination of IME with DDP. In-vivo studies have shown that IME and DDP, independently or in combination, may significantly inhibit the metastasis of OS to the lungs. Conclusion: IME may reduce the resistance of OS cells to DDP to some extent.|Cancer
ID:31240453|Title:[Round-cell sarcomas].Abstract:Round-cell sarcomas represent highly malignant tumors that occur predominantly in children, adolescents, and young adults. Round-cell sarcomas are caused by recurrent translocations that involve certain transcription factors. Ewing's sarcoma, Ewing-like sarcomas (e.g. CIC-DUX positive or BCOR positive sarcomas), desmoplastic small round-cell tumors (DSRCTs), and alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (ARMs) are typical examples of this particular group of sarcomas. These entities differ in their tumor genetics, which is correlated with immunohistochemical expression profiles and with clinical phenotypes. Classification should be based on molecular findings. Immunohistochemistry may serve as a surrogate marker.|Cancer
ID:31240697|Title:Circular RNAs: A novel biomarker for cervical cancer.Abstract:Besides messenger RNAs, recent RNA-Seq and biochemical analysis showed another type of RNAs as a product of splicing which is named circular RNA (circRNA). Evidence demonstrated that circRNAs are abundant in the cells and are able to show cell/tissue-specific expression or tissue developmental stage which suggest that circRNAs may have regulatory potentials. In recent years, researchers have focused attention on circRNAs because of their key functions in various cellular mechanisms. CircRNAs also have the potential to be as promising biomarkers for diagnosis of various diseases such as cancer. Growing up evidence has shown the various roles of circRNAs in multiple cancers. In recent years, cervical cancer as one of the main causes of cancer death in women has been interesting for molecular research. CircRNAs are one of the novel objects which have recently been evaluated in this cancer. The improvement in our knowledge of the roles of circRNAs in cervical cancer may lead to new transcription therapeutic approaches to cervical cancer inhibition. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to review many studies which examined the role of circRNAs in cervical cancer carcinogenesis and progression up till date and to summarize possible mechanisms of action of circRNAs in cervical neoplasm.|Cancer
ID:31241739|Title:Establishment of permutation for cancer risk estimation in the urothelium based on genome-wide DNA methylation analysis.Abstract:The aim of this study was to establish permutation for cancer risk estimation in the urothelium. Twenty-six samples of normal control urothelium obtained from patients without urothelial carcinomas (C), 47 samples of non-cancerous urothelium without noticeable morphological changes obtained from patients with urothelial carcinomas (N), and 46 samples of the corresponding cancerous tissue (T) in the learning cohort and 64 N samples in the validation cohort, i.e. 183 tissue samples in total, were analyzed. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip, and DNA methylation levels were verified using pyrosequencing and MassARRAY. Amplicon sequencing was performed using the GeneRead DNAseq Targeted Panels V2. Although N samples rarely showed genetic mutations or copy number alterations, they showed DNA methylation alterations at 2502 CpG sites compared to C samples, and such alterations were inherited by or strengthened in T samples, indicating that DNA methylation alterations may participate in field cancerization in the urothelium. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis confirmed the feasibility of cancer risk estimation to identify urothelium at the precancerous stage by DNA methylation quantification. Cancer risk estimation permutation was established using a combination of two marker CpG loci on the HOXC4, TENM3 and TLR1 genes (sensitivity and specificity 96-100%). Among them, the diagnostic impact of 10 patterns of permutation was successfully validated in the validation cohort (sensitivity and specificity 94-98%). These data suggest that cancer risk estimation using procedures such as urine tests during health checkups might become applicable for clinical use.|Cancer
ID:31242861|Title:DOCK8 mutation diagnosed using whole-exome sequencing of the dried blood spot-derived DNA: a case report of an Iraqi girl diagnosed in Japan.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency (MIM #243700) is a rare disease, leads to a combined primary immunodeficiency (PID), and accounts for the autosomal recessive-hyper immunoglobulin E syndrome (AR-HIES). DOCK8 deficiency status characterizes by recurrent infections, atopy, and risk of cancer. Lymphoproliferative disease complicating PID, is difficult to diagnose. Our aim is to present a rare case of PID, and to the best of our knowledge, she is the first case of DOCK8 deficiency from Iraq. The genetic diagnosis was carried out in Japan using dried blood spot-based DNA transfer and whole-exome sequencing. CASE PRESENTATION: An 11-year-old Iraqi girl, of double first-cousin-parents, had a history of severe eczema, food allergy, and repeated infections. She presented with a jaw mass, bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, and immunoglobulin (Ig) assays of 20, 3.3 and 1.7-fold above maximum normal level for age of IgE, IgA and IgG, respectively, along with a low IgM, eosinophilia and lymphopenia. Based on the jaw mass biopsy, non-Hodgkin lymphoma was suggested in Iraq, whereas histopathological re-evaluation in Japan revealed the diagnosis of a polyclonal reactive proliferation spectrum of lymphoproliferative disorders/plasmacytic hyperplasia, complicating PID. Whole-exome sequencing supported the diagnosis of PID by identifying a homozygous DOCK8 mutation with previously reported pathogenicity (NM_203447:c.3332delT, p.Phe1113Leufs*2), that may be attributed to consanguinity. CONCLUSIONS: International collaboration using an effective DNA transportation technique and next-generation sequencing was the key to pinpoint the diagnosis of DOCK8 deficiency. Our case asserted that careful pathogenetic evaluation, in an advanced setting, was crucial for ruling out the neoplastic process. Pediatricians in areas with a high prevalence of consanguinity marriage should have a high index of suspicion of DOCK8 deficiency in patients with recalcitrant eczema, and frequent respiratory and skin infectious episodes.|Cancer
ID:31243107|Title:STK11 p.G270W: A Novel Mutation Detected in a Case of MSI High Mixed Medullary-Mucinous Carcinoma of the Transverse Colon.Abstract:BACKGROUND/AIM: To report a case of mixed medullary/mucinous adenocarcinoma with unusual mutational gene profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 79-year-old female was diagnosed with a colorectal carcinoma of the transverse colon. The diagnostic work-up of this case included thorough clinicopathological evaluation, immunohistochemistry and next generation Sequencing. RESULTS: The clinicopathological evaluation showed a tumor with morphological features of both medullary and mucinous colorectal carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed the loss of DNA mismatch repair proteins. NGS showed that the medullary component of this tumor had a novel STK11 p.G270W mutation, which was not present in the mucinous component. Both the medullary and mucinous components also had BRAF V600E and AKT1 (pE17K) mutations. CONCLUSION: We report a novel mutation STK11 (p.G270W), in medullary carcinoma of the colon with an associated mucinous component.|Cancer
ID:31244296|Title:Identification of FLT3 and NPM1 Mutations in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.Abstract:Objective: The most frequent acquired molecular abnormalities and important prognostic indicators in patientswith Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) are fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 gene (FLT3) and nucleophosmin-1 (NPM1)mutations. Our study aims to develop a cost effective and comprehensive in-house conventional PCR method fordetection of FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835 and NPM1 mutations and to evaluate the frequency of these mutations in patientswith cytogenetically normal (CN) AML in our population. Methods: A total of 199 samples from AML patients (95women, 104 men) were included in the study. Mutation analyses were performed using polymerase chain reaction(PCR) and gene sequencing. Result: Sixty-eight patients were positive for the mutations. FLT3-ITD mutations weredetected in 32 patients (16.1%), followed by FLT3-D835 in 5 (2.5%) and NPM1 in 54 (27.1%). Double mutations ofNPM1 and FLT3-ITD were detected in 23 cases (11.6%). Assays validation were performed using Sanger sequencingand showed 100% concordance with in house method. Conclusion: The optimized in-house PCR assays for thedetection of FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835 and NPM1 mutations in AML patients were robust, less labour intensive and costeffective. These assays can be used as diagnostic tools for mutation detection in AML patients since identification ofthese mutations are important for prognostication and optimization of patient care.|Cancer

ID:31247903|Title:Leveraging the Role of the Metastatic Associated Protein Anterior Gradient Homologue 2 in Unfolded Protein Degradation: A Novel Therapeutic Biomarker for Cancer.Abstract:Effective diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers can help in tracking disease progress, predict patients' survival, and considerably affect the drive for successful clinical management. The present review aims to determine how the metastatic-linked protein anterior gradient homologue 2 (AGR2) operates to affect cancer progression, and to identify associated potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers, particularly in central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Studies that show a high expression level of AGR2, and associate the protein expression with the resilience to chemotherapeutic treatments or with poor cancer survival, are reported. The primary protein structures of the seven variants of AGR2, including their functional domains, are summarized. Based on experiments in various biological models, this review shows an orchestra of multiple molecules that regulate AGR2 expression, including a feedback loop with p53. The AGR2-associated molecular functions and pathways including genomic integrity, proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, adhesion, migration, stemness, and inflammation, are detailed. In addition, the mechanisms that can enable the rampant oncogenic effects of AGR2 are clarified. The different strategies used to therapeutically target AGR2-positive cancer cells are evaluated in light of the current evidence. Moreover, novel associated pathways and clinically relevant deregulated genes in AGR2 high CNS tumors are identified using a meta-analysis approach.|Cancer
ID:31248416|Title:Identification of novel pathogenic MSH2 mutation and new DNA repair genes variants: investigation of a Tunisian Lynch syndrome family with discordant twins.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome (LS) is a highly penetrant inherited cancer predisposition syndrome, characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes. Despite several genetic variations that have been identified in various populations, the penetrance is highly variable and the reasons for this have not been fully elucidated. This study investigates whether, besides pathogenic mutations, environment and low penetrance genetic risk factors may result in phenotype modification in a Tunisian LS family. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Tunisian family with strong colorectal cancer (CRC) history that fulfill the Amsterdam I criteria for the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome was proposed for oncogenetic counseling. The index case was a man, diagnosed at the age of 33 years with CRC. He has a monozygotic twin diagnosed at the age of 35 years with crohn disease. Forty-seven years-old was the onset age of his paternal uncle withCRC. An immunohistochemical (IHC) labeling for the four proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) of the MisMatchRepair (MMR) system was performed for the index case. A targeted sequencing of MSH2, MLH1 and a panel of 85 DNA repair genes was performed for the index case and for his unaffected father. RESULTS: The IHC results showed a loss of MSH2 but not MLH1, MSH6 and PMS2 proteins expression. Genomic DNA screening, by targeted DNA repair genes sequencing, revealed an MSH2 pathogenic mutation (c.1552C>T; p.Q518X), confirmed by Sanger sequencing. This mutation was suspected to be a causal mutation associated to the loss of MSH2 expression and it was found in first and second degree relatives. The index case has smoking and alcohol consumption habits. Moreover, he harbors extensive genetic variations in other DNA-repair genes not shared with his unaffected father. CONCLUSION: In our investigated Tunisian family, we confirmed the LS by IHC, molecular and in silico investigations. We identified a novel pathogenic mutation described for the first time in Tunisia. These results come enriching the previously reported pathogenic mutations in LS families. Our study brings new arguments to the interpretation of MMR expression pattern and highlights new risk modifiers genes eventually implicated in CRC. Twins discordance reported in this work underscore that disease penetrance could be influenced by both genetic background and environmental factors.|Cancer
ID:31248429|Title:Case report: mutation analysis of primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma via whole-exome sequencing.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) is a rare tumor subtype accounting for around 0.9% of lung cancers. At present, research on LELC mainly focuses on pathological diagnosis, while the molecular mutation landscape is still unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old female presented a productive cough for three weeks followed by severe symptoms for another week. Respiratory sounds were weak and coarser in the right lung field. F-FDG PET-CTA showed a hypermetabolic mass in the upper lobe of the right lung as well as the enlargement of right hilar and subcarinal lymph nodes. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry staining of the biopsy established the diagnosis of primary pulmonary LELC. After thoracoscopic-assisted radical resection of right lung cancer and middle lobe of right lung, the patient's vital signs were stable without apparent productive cough, chest pain, chest tightness and other subjective discomforts. Furtherwhole exome sequencing of the patient's tumor tissue and leukocytes (served as a germline mutation control) revealed 613 somatic gene mutations, and of which mutations in PRIM2, KCNB1, CDH1, and ATRX were most likely related to the LELC pathogenesis. The recurrence of gene mutations from various cancers database and a tumor mutation burden (TMB) of 18.7 mutations/mb were revealed as well. CONCLUSION: Our findings have illustrated the genomic profile of a primary pulmonary LELC case and provided a positive biomarker that immune checkpoint blockade is potentially effective for this patient in further treatment.|Cancer
ID:31248668|Title:Molecular classification of endometrial carcinoma applied to endometrial biopsy specimens: Towards early personalized patient management.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The current risk stratification systems used to guide management of endometrial cancer are based on irreproducible post surgical pathological information, hence the need for more reliable classification systems. Using microarray and sequencing technologies, TCGA recently identified four prognostically significant endometrial carcinoma subtypes, which subsequently proved reproducible using clinically applicable surrogate tests. Using these tests, we sought to determine the level of concordance between endometrial biopsies and subsequent hysterectomy specimens in assessing the molecular classification of endometrial carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty biopsies with corresponding hysterectomy specimens for endometrial carcinomas were collected. Additionally, 10 cases of biopsy proven atypical hyperplasia/EIN who were found to have endometrial carcinoma on resection were included. IHC for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6) and P53 was performed. Microsatellite instability analysis was performed by PCR and Sanger sequencing was performed to detect mutations in exons 9 and 13 of the POLE gene. The level of concordance for tumor grade, histologic subtype, immunohistochemical and molecular profile in both specimens was determined using Cohen's kappa estimates. RESULTS: A high level of concordance was achieved for MMR-loss, MSI-high, P53-wild and abnormal types. In contrast, grade and histologic subtype showed only moderate levels of agreement. POLE gene mutation was detected in two patients. For both cases, mutations were detected only in resection specimens. When comparing atypical hyperplasia/EIN with subsequent hysterectomy tumor, the profile was identical to that of endometrial carcinoma. CONCLUSION: In our cohort of endometrial carcinoma, a high level of concordance was achieved between biopsy and hysterectomy specimens for MMR-loss, MSI-high, P53-wild and abnormal types, superior to that of grade and histologic subtype, providing earlier and more reliable prognostic information to inform management. Similar concordance could not be achieved for POLE mutation, given the low frequency of this mutation in our study.|Cancer

ID:31254135|Title:A long-term survivor of pediatric midline glioma with H3F3A K27M and BRAF V600E double mutations.Abstract:We report a case of 2-year-old female with lateral ventricular glioma harboring both H3F3A K27M and BRAF V600E mutations. By the methylation analysis, the tumor was classified as a diffuse midline glioma H3 K27M mutant, WHO grade IV. However, the tumor was pathologically low-grade and likely localized rather than diffusely infiltrating. Further, the patient has survived more than 8 years after gross total resection of the tumor. Whereas both H3F3A K27M and BRAF V600E have been reported as poor prognostic markers in pediatric glioma, our case, along with several other reported cases, suggests that the coexistence of these two mutations might not indicate poor prognosis. The case emphasizes the importance of comprehensive assessment based on pathological, genetic and clinical findings and calls for further investigations of non-diffuse glioma with H3F3A K27M and glioma with H3F3A K27M and BRAF V600E.|Cancer
ID:31260379|Title:Safe neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based treatment in HER2 + inflammatory early breast cancer in a glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient postmenopausal woman: A case report and review of the literature.Abstract:INTRODUCTION: Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a basic antioxidant pathway for erythrocytes, being its deficiency the most common gene mutation worldwide. As breast cancer is one of the most frequent tumors, many of these patients may present with G6PD deficiency prior treatment without notice. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a woman deficient for G6PD with the diagnosis of Stage IIIB (cT4d cN1 cM0) HER2-enriched early breast cancer. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: The patient underwent neoadjuvance with trastuzumab and anthracycline-free chemotherapy, based on docetaxel (75 mg/m2, 120 mg) and carboplatin (AUC 5, 560 mg). She did not present hemolytic crisis and no blood transfusions were needed. She achieved a good pathologic response and completed one-year adjuvant trastuzumab without incidences. DISCUSSION: Although the role of HER2 and trastuzumab in oxidative stress is not yet completely understood, we suggest that trastuzumab may be a suitable agent for treatment in patients with HER2-enriched breast cancer in a non-oxidative chemotherapy scheme, with acceptable responses and no triggering hemolytic crisis.|Cancer
ID:31263451|Title:Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1): An Update and the Significance of Early Genetic and Clinical Diagnosis.Abstract:Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare hereditary tumor syndrome inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and characterized by a predisposition to a multitude of endocrine neoplasms primarily of parathyroid, enteropancreatic, and anterior pituitary origin, as well as nonendocrine neoplasms. Other endocrine tumors in MEN1 include foregut carcinoid tumors, adrenocortical tumors, and rarely pheochromocytoma. Nonendocrine manifestations include meningiomas and ependymomas, lipomas, angiofibromas, collagenomas, and leiomyomas. MEN1 is caused by inactivating mutations of the tumor suppressor gene MEN1 which encodes the protein menin. This syndrome can affect all age groups, with 17% of patients developing MEN1-associated tumors before 21 years of age. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of MEN1-associated tumors, patients with MEN1 continue to have decreased life expectancy primarily due to malignant neuroendocrine tumors. The most recent clinical practice guidelines for MEN1, published in 2012, highlight the need for early genetic and clinical diagnosis of MEN1 and recommend an intensive surveillance approach for both patients with this syndrome and asymptomatic carriers starting at the age of 5 years with the goal of timely detection and management of MEN1-associated neoplasms and ultimately decreased disease-specific morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation and individual mutation-dependent surveillance is not possible currently.|Cancer
ID:31263500|Title:Challenges in Managing Patients with Hereditary Cancer at Gynecological Services.Abstract:AIM: To reveal current problems and challenges faced by our gynecologic services department in managing patients with hereditary cancers. METHODS: We collected clinical data of patients with hereditary cancers, identified via genetic testing (or clinically diagnosed in cases of Cowden syndrome or Peutz-Jeghers syndrome), and treated in our gynecological department from 2012 to 2018. RESULTS: Fifteen patients had hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), 6 had Lynch syndrome, 2 had Cowden syndrome, and 2 had Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Five patients diagnosed with HBOC were younger than 40 years at diagnosis. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) was performed on 1 patient with a BRCA1 mutation at age 38 years. Seven patients overall underwent RRSO, and none had malignancies on pathological examinations. Peritoneal washing cytology (PWC) was suspicious for malignancy in one patient; however, subsequent PWC at 6 months after RRSO was negative. A patient with endometrial cancer and Lynch syndrome and a patient with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) and Cowden syndrome strongly desired fertility preservation. They achieved remission after medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment and multiple dilations and curettages, respectively. One patient with Lynch syndrome developed AEH after 11 years of surveillance. Laparotomy revealed adjacent low-grade and high-grade serous ovarian cancer with positive ascites cytology. She had no recurrence during 7-year follow-up after laparotomy. CONCLUSION: Managing patients with hereditary cancer, positive or false-positive ascites cytology discovered during RRSO, and desired preservation of fertility is highly challenging.|Cancer
ID:31264352|Title:Prognostic and predictive significance of KIT protein expression and c-kit gene mutation in canine cutaneous mast cell tumours: A consensus of the Oncology-Pathology Working Group.Abstract:One of the primary objectives of the Oncology-Pathology Working Group (OPWG), a joint initiative of the Veterinary Cancer Society and the American College of Veterinary Pathologists, is for oncologists and pathologists to collaboratively generate consensus documents to standardize aspects of and provide guidelines for oncologic pathology. Consensus is established through critical review of peer-reviewed literature relevant to a subgroup's particular focus. Subsequent acceptance and approval of the document by the OPWG membership at large establishes consensus. The intent of this publication is to help educate practitioners and pathologists on the value of diagnostics related to the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase for canine cutaneous mast cell tumours and to provide a guide for the use of these tests in veterinary medicine. This document represents the opinions of the OPWG and the authors and does not constitute a formal endorsement by the American College of Veterinary Pathologists or the Veterinary Cancer Society.|Cancer
ID:31266596|Title:Renal cell carcinomas with a mesenchymal stromal component: what do we know so far?Abstract:A subset of renal cell neoplasms contains a mesenchymal stromal component, often resembling smooth muscle. To date, it remains debated whether these represent one or more distinct pathological entities. The foremost of these, renal cell carcinoma with angioleiomyoma-like stroma (also known as smooth muscle or leiomyomatous stroma), has some distinctive features, including immunohistochemical positivity for cytokeratin 7 and often a lack of genetic changes of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. It is debated whether this is related to the much more common clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma, owing to the substantial similarity of their immunohistochemical phenotypes. The term renal angiomyoadenomatous tumour has been used by some authors in this context, but this is a source of controversy with some believing it is synonymous with clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma. Smooth muscle-rich renal cancers appear to be enriched in tuberous sclerosis complex patients, but it is likely that these occur sporadically also. Recently, renal cell carcinomas with TCEB1 mutation and monosomy of chromosome 8 have also been reported. These have been noted to have fibromuscular stroma and cytokeratin 7 reactivity; however, absence of these genetic alterations in renal cell carcinomas with smooth muscle stroma suggests that this represents only one of likely several entities. Other uncommon patterns of renal neoplasms, such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma with degenerative fibrosis or haemangioma-like changes, mixed epithelial and stromal tumour with epithelial proliferation, angiomyolipoma with epithelial cysts, renal cell carcinoma with associated angiomyolipoma, and sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma may cause diagnostic challenges for the pathologist. Although knowledge of renal cell carcinomas with a stromal component has dramatically increased recently, further study is necessary to understand the molecular pathology of these tumours and if they have implications for inherited tumour syndromes.|Cancer
ID:31268928|Title:Melanotic Schwannoma of the Vulva: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.Abstract:Melanotic schwannoma is a pigmented tumor of peripheral nerve differentiation. Primary cutaneous presentations are extremely rare, as the bulk of melanotic schwannomas tend to develop in paraspinal and axial sites. Tumors arise sporadically and in the setting of the Carney complex. Alterations in the gene encoding protein kinase A regulatory subunit-alpha (PRKAR1A) underlie most patients with the Carney complex and mediate melanotic schwannoma tumorigenesis. Melanotic schwannomas from noncutaneous sites can locally recur and metastasize widely, leading to a recent proposal to change the nomenclature to "malignant melanotic schwannian tumor." However, the clinicopathologic features of primary cutaneous melanotic schwannomas are relatively unexplored. We present a case of a nodule arising on the vulva of a 34-year-old woman. Microscopically, a dermal-based, heavily pigmented proliferation of plump spindled and epithelioid cells arrayed in nodules and fascicles was seen. Lesional cells stained positively for S100, Melan-A, and BAP1 but were negative for Prkar1alpha. Next-generation sequencing of a panel of 480 cancer-associated genes revealed that the tumor harbored a PRKAR1A p.S299fs truncating mutation and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 17q, the locus at which PRKAR1A resides. Importantly, no other genetic abnormalities or chromosomal copy number changes were identified. On the basis of combined histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic features, a diagnosis of melanotic schwannoma was rendered. Overall, we present the first clinicopathologic description of a vulvar melanotic schwannoma, review the literature concerning cutaneous presentations of melanotic schwannoma, and propose that melanotic schwannian tumors native to skin may behave more indolently than their noncutaneous counterparts.|Cancer

ID:31277093|Title:Sarcomatoid carcinoma after radiotherapy for early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma: Case report.Abstract:RATIONALE: Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with poor prognosis. Previous radiation has been reported as one of the etiologic factors. PATIENT CONCERNS: We describe a case of a 57-year-old man presented with a painless mass in the left supraclavicular area. Five years before, he was diagnosed with SCC in floor of mouth (FOM) and underwent radiotherapy (RT). DIAGNOSES: Sonography-guided biopsy on the supraclavicular lymph node revealed diffuse spindle cell proliferation with a focus of squamous differentiation. Local recurrence on primary site or distant metastasis was not obvious on both computed tomography (CT) of the neck and F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT. The final diagnosis was confirmed as sarcomatoid carcinoma via surgery. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent surgery including explorative resection of the mouth floor, excision of the submandibular gland, and modified radical neck dissection. Following surgery, the patient received adjuvant radiation therapy. OUTCOMES: There were no complications according to the surgery. Six months after adjuvant therapy, distant metastasis to liver was identified. The patient is currently undergoing palliative chemotherapy. LESSONS: This may be the first reported case of sarcomatoid carcinoma arising from early-stage SCC in FOM that was previously treated with RT alone. When RT is performed as a single modality for oral SCC, even in an early stage, rigorous follow-up should be performed.|Cancer
ID:31278395|Title:The Cancer Genome Atlas of renal cell carcinoma: findings and clinical implications.Abstract:The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) characterized the somatic genetic and genomic alterations in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) encompassing the major RCC histological subtypes, including clear cell RCC (ccRCC), papillary RCC (pRCC) and chromophobe RCC (chRCC). Unique distinguishing features were found between the RCC subtypes, including in chromosomal alterations and tumour metabolism, as well as within each RCC subtype, of which some correlated with differences in patient survival. Two new RCC subtypes were defined by distinct epigenetic and metabolic pathway expression patterns, the hypermethylated CpG island methylator phenotype-associated (CIMP) RCCs and metabolically divergent chRCCs, and new biomarkers of poor patient outcome were identified, including PBRM1 mutation in type 1 pRCC and CDKN2A loss in chRCC. Expression of many immune cell gene-specific signatures was increased in ccRCC compared with pRCC and chRCC, and expression of select signatures, including the type 2 T helper cell signature, was increased in CIMP RCC. Increased expression of the type 2 T helper cell signature correlated with poorer survival in ccRCC, pRCC and chRCC. In addition to improving our current understanding of RCC, TCGA RCC studies are an invaluable resource that provides the foundation for the development of improved methods for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of this disease.|Cancer
ID:31278738|Title:Molecular Genetics in the Diagnosis and Biology of Lymphoid Neoplasms.Abstract:OBJECTIVES: The 2017 Workshop of the Society for Hematopathology/European Association for Haematopathology reviewed the role of molecular genetics in the diagnosis and biology of lymphoid neoplasms. METHODS: The Workshop Panel reviewed 82 cases. RESULTS: Molecular genetic testing reveals alterations that expand the spectrum of diseases such as DUSP22 rearrangement in ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma, large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement, MYD88 mutations in B-cell lymphomas, Burkitt-like lymphoma with 11q aberrations, and diagnostic criteria for high-grade B-cell lymphomas. Therapeutic agents and natural tumor progression may be associated with transcriptional reprogramming that lead to transdifferentiation and lineage switch. CONCLUSIONS: Application of emerging technical advances has revealed the complexity of genetic events in lymphomagenesis, progression, and acquired resistance to therapies. They also contribute to enhanced understanding of the biology of indolent vs aggressive behavior, clonal evolution, tumor progression, and transcriptional reprogramming associated with transdifferentiation events that may occur subsequent to therapy.|Cancer

The leading histopathological subtype of adrenal lymphoma is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is rare. Here, we report a case of IVLBCL occurrence as a bilateral adrenal gland tumor, which was diagnosed by CT-guided biopsy. Tumor cells were positive for CD20 and MUM-1 but not for CD10 on immunostaining, suggesting non-germinal center B-cell subtype lymphoma. In addition, the triple expression of BCL2, BCL6, and MYC was demonstrated on tumor cells. The bone marrow examination revealed the involvement of lymphoma cells but not hemophagocytosis. The chromosomal analysis revealed complex karyotypic abnormalities without a rearrangement of BCL2 or MYC using FISH analysis. Although the patient responded to R-CHOP chemotherapy, he developed central nervous system involvement by lymphoma. To date, the significance of the triple expression of BCL2, BCL6, and MYC without gene translocation remains partially elucidated. Therefore, an accumulation of similar cases is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis and clinical significance of the triple expression of these oncoproteins.|Cancer
ID:31281162|Title:[Genetic analysis of Japanese patients with Fanconi anemia: novel findings].Abstract:Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by multiple congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and a predisposition to malignancies, resulting from mutations in one of the 22 known FANC genes (from FANCA to FANCW). The proteins encoded by these genes participate in a deoxyribonucleic acid interstrand cross-link repair pathway, the so-called FA/BRCA pathway. The 22 FANC genes include hereditary breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. Patients with FA display a wide range of clinical phenotypes owing to the genetic heterogeneity of the disease; therefore, the molecular diagnosis is critical for the appropriate management of such patients. Recently, we successfully subtyped 97% of the 117 Japanese patients with FA and identified 215 mutant alleles through a comprehensive strategy. In this review, the characteristics of genetic subtyping and mutated FANC gene variants in Japanese patients with FA and the genotype-phenotype correlation in FA are summarized. In addition, the carrier frequency of pathogenic FANC genes and risk of cancer among the FANC gene mutation carriers in general Japanese population are discussed.|Cancer
ID:31283845|Title:Mesothelioma: Scientific clues for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.Abstract:Mesothelioma affects mostly older individuals who have been occupationally exposed to asbestos. The global mesothelioma incidence and mortality rates are unknown, because data are not available from developing countries that continue to use large amounts of asbestos. The incidence rate of mesothelioma has decreased in Australia, the United States, and Western Europe, where the use of asbestos was banned or strictly regulated in the 1970s and 1980s, demonstrating the value of these preventive measures. However, in these same countries, the overall number of deaths from mesothelioma has not decreased as the size of the population and the percentage of old people have increased. Moreover, hotspots of mesothelioma may occur when carcinogenic fibers that are present in the environment are disturbed as rural areas are being developed. Novel immunohistochemical and molecular markers have improved the accuracy of diagnosis; however, about 14% (high-resource countries) to 50% (developing countries) of mesothelioma diagnoses are incorrect, resulting in inadequate treatment and complicating epidemiological studies. The discovery that germline BRCA1-asssociated protein 1 (BAP1) mutations cause mesothelioma and other cancers (BAP1 cancer syndrome) elucidated some of the key pathogenic mechanisms, and treatments targeting these molecular mechanisms and/or modulating the immune response are being tested. The role of surgery in pleural mesothelioma is controversial as it is difficult to predict who will benefit from aggressive management, even when local therapies are added to existing or novel systemic treatments. Treatment outcomes are improving, however, for peritoneal mesothelioma. Multidisciplinary international collaboration will be necessary to improve prevention, early detection, and treatment.|Cancer
ID:31292797|Title:Lynch syndrome with exclusive skin involvement: time to consider a molecular definition?Abstract:Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is clinically characterized by the occurrence of skin, usually sebaceous, and visceral tumors in the same individual. The most common underlying mechanism is a constitutional defect of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes that cause Lynch syndrome (LS). Herewithin we report on a 76 years-old male patient heterozygous for a pathogenic MSH2 missense substitution who presented with a striking cutaneous phenotype in the absence of typical LS visceral tumors. The patient developed 20 skin tumors, including sebaceous adenomas/carcinomas and keratoacanthomas. Two skin tumors showed immunohistochemical loss of MSH2 and MSH6 expression. There was no apparent family history of neoplasia. Based on the variable involvement of the skin and internal organs, we suggest that the definition of tumor associations that are often observed as variants of inherited tumor syndromes, such as MTS, should be guided by the underlying molecular bases. In addition, the presence of multiple sebaceous tumors, especially if showing MMR deficiency, appears to be a very strong indicator of a constitutional MMR gene defect. The reasons underlying the high phenotypic variability of cutaneous phenotypes associated with constitutional MMR defects are yet to be determined.|Cancer
ID:31292799|Title:Double heterozygous mutation in the BRCA1 and ATM genes involved in development of primary metachronous tumours: a case report.Abstract:PURPOSE: Between 5 and 10% of cases of breast cancer (BC) are attributable to a genetic susceptibility. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes described in the late 1990s are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, and the clinical management of carriers of pathogenic variants in these genes is defined in several clinical guidelines (Paluch-Shimon et al. in Ann Oncol 27(suppl 5):v103-v110, 2016; Llort et al. in Clin Transl Oncol 17(12):956-961, 2015). However, the pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 represent only a third of the causes of hereditary BC (Easton et al. in N Engl J Med 372:2243-2257, 2015). The incorporation of NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) techniques in the genetic diagnosis of this pathology, in addition to minimising the cost and time of analysis, allows the simultaneous study of other genes of high and moderate penetrance (Easton et al. in N Engl J Med 372:2243-2257, 2015; Op. Cit.; Tung et al. in Cancer 121(1):25-33, 2015). To date, there are not many cases or series of patients that describe the co-occurrence of two pathogenic variants in these genes of BC. Cases of double heterozygosis have been described with the presence of pathogenic variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2, BLM or NBN (Nomizu et al. in Breast Cancer 22(5):557-61, 2015; Heidemann et al. in Breast Cancer Res Treat 134(3):1229-1239, 2012; Zuradelli et al. in Breast Cancer Res Treat 124(1):251-258, 2010; Sokolenko et al. in Breast Cancer Res Treat 145(2):553-562, 2014). METHODS: We report the case of a patient diagnosed with multiple tumours who presented two pathogenic variants in heterozygosis. RESULTS: Two pathogenic variants, c.5123C > A (p.Ala1708Glu) in the BRCA1 gene and c.2413C > T (p.Arg805X) in the ATM gene were detected in heterozygosis. Said variants were confirmed by Sanger-type sequencing using specific primers. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of gene panels using NGS in the study of hereditary cancer involves the detection of heterozygous double mutations in genes of high and moderate penetrance for cancer, although with a low frequency.|Cancer
ID:31294922|Title:Elevated N-methyltransferase expression induced by hepatic stellate cells contributes to the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma via regulation of the CD44v3 isoform.Abstract:The cross-talk between hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and hepatic carcinoma cells contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. We report here that activated HSCs induce upregulation of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), which is known to regulate multiple metabolic pathways in hepatoma cells of the liver. High levels of NNMT in HCC tissues were positively correlated with vascular invasion, increased serum HBV-DNA levels, and distant metastasis. In addition, functional assays showed that NNMT promoted HCC cell invasion and metastasis by altering the histone H3 methylation on 27 methylation pattern and transcriptionally activating cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44). NNMT-mediated N6-methyladenosine modification of CD44 mRNA resulted in the formation of a CD44v3 splice variant, while its product 1-methyl-nicotinamide stabilized CD44 protein by preventing ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Finally, NNMT was also shown to be a target of statins that inhibited metastasis of hepatoma cells. Taken together, our study shows for the first time that the NNMT/CD44v3 axis regulates HCC metastasis and presents NNMT as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.|Cancer
ID:31296311|Title:p53 major hotspot variants are associated with poorer prognostic features in hereditary cancer patients.Abstract:TP53 pathogenic germline variation is associated with the multi-cancer predisposition Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Next-generation sequencing and multigene panel testing are highlighting variability in the clinical presentation of patients with TP53 positive results. We aimed to investigate if the p53 variants considered as major hotspots at both germline and somatic levels (p.Arg175His, p.Gly245Asp, p.Gly245Ser, p.Arg248Gln, p.Arg248Trp, p.Arg273Cys, p.Arg273His, and p.Arg282Trp) were associated with poorer prognostic features compared to other pathogenic missense variants in the DNA-binding domain. To do so, we assessed clinical features from 1025 carriers of germline TP53 pathogenic variants (749 probands and 276 relatives) from three independent datasets (IARC TP53 Database, Ambry Single Gene Testing, and Ambry Multigene Panel Testing). We observed that, compared to carriers of non-hotspot germline variants, individuals that carried a hotspot germline variant were more likely to present with a Classic LFS phenotype, earlier age of first breast cancer onset, and shorter time to diagnosis to any cancer. Further studies with larger datasets addressing differences in cancer phenotypes by genotype are thus needed to replicate our findings and consider variant effect and position, towards future personalized clinical management of pathogenic variant carriers.|Cancer
ID:31296812|Title:[Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome].Abstract:Recently, olaparib(brand name: Lynparza Tablets)-a PARP inhibitor-has been approved for national health insurance coverage in Japan as a drug for unresectable or recurrent, BRCA1/2-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer in patients with a history of cancer chemotherapy. The addition of BRCA1/2 genetic testing as a companion diagnostic tool to the health insurance coverage is of considerable significance as a spearhead of health insurance medical care for all different types of hereditary tumors. However, several problems related to this companion diagnostic test have emerged, including the estab- lishment of a genetic counseling system and handling of BRCA1/2 genetic tests performed at the patients' own expense. In addition, the purpose of the companion diagnostic test is to confirm drug indication in a case. However, since the test results include the diagnosis of hereditary tumors, there is also an urgent need to improve the medical care system and social environment for family members of patients with pathological mutations. The use of genetic analysis is widespread in the clinical settings, and genetic medical care is anticipated to advance in the future. Therefore, it would be pivotal to come up with measures against hereditary tumors, such as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer(HBOC)syndrome. In this chapter, we describe the current status and prospects of HBOC medical care, with a particular focus on companion diagnostics.|Cancer
ID:31297240|Title:Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment in patients with oncogene- addicted non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): summary of a multidisciplinary round-table discussion.Abstract:The introduction of targeted treatments and more recently immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) to the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has dramatically changed the prognosis of selected patients. For patients with oncogene-addicted metastatic NSCLC harbouring an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF) mutation or an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) gene alteration (translocation, fusion, amplification) mutation-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are already first-line standard treatment, while targeted treatment for other driver mutations affecting MET, RET, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2, tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK) 1-3 and others are currently under investigation. The role of ICI in these patient subgroups is currently under debate. This article summarises a round-table discussion organised by ESMO Open in Vienna in July 2018. It reviews current clinical data on ICI treatment in patients with metastatic oncogene-addicted NSCLC and discusses molecular diagnostic assessment, potential biomarkers and radiological methods for response evaluation of ICI treatment. The round-table panel concluded ICI should only be considered in patients with oncogene-addicted NSCLC after exhaustion of effective targeted therapies and in some cases possibly after all other therapies including chemotherapies. More clinical trials on combination therapies and biomarkers for ICI therapy based on the specific differing characteristics of oncogene-addicted NSCLC need to be conducted.|Cancer
ID:31299995|Title:Genomic landscape and its correlations with tumor mutational burden, PD-L1 expression, and immune cells infiltration in Chinese lung squamous cell carcinoma.Abstract:INTRODUCTION: To depict the genomic landscape of Chinese early-stage lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and investigate its correlation with tumor mutation burden (TMB), PD-L1 expression, and immune infiltrates. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 189 surgically resected LUSC. TMB was defined as the sum of nonsynonymous single nucleotide and indel variants. CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density and PD-L1 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Six immune infiltrates were estimated using an online database. RESULTS: The median TMB was 9.43 mutations per megabase. Positive PD-L1 expression and CD8+ TILs density were identified in 24.3% and 78.8%. PIK3CA amplification was associated with significantly higher TMB (P = 0.036). Frequent genetic alterations had no impact on PD-L1 expression but PIK3CA amplification and KEAP1 mutation were independently associated with significantly lower CD8+ TIL density (P < 0.001, P = 0.005, respectively). Low TMB and high CD8+ TIL density were independently associated with longer disease-free survival (DFS) while none of them could individually predict the overall survival (OS). Combination of TMB and PD-L1 expression or TMB and CD8+ TIL density could stratify total populations into two groups with distinct prognosis. Classifying tumor-immune microenvironment based on PD-L1 expression and CD8+ TIL density showed discrepant genomic alterations but similar TMB, clinical features, and OS. Notably, patients with different smoking status had distinct prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: The combination of TMB, PD-L1 expression, immune infiltrates, and smoking status showed the feasibility to subgroup stratification in Chinese patients with early-stage LUSC, which might be helpful for future design of personalized immunotherapy trials in LUSC.|Cancer
ID:31300532|Title:Dataset for the reporting of renal biopsy for tumour: recommendations from the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR).Abstract:The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) has developed a suite of detailed datasets for international implementation. These datasets are based on the reporting protocols developed by the Royal College of Pathologists (UK), The Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and the College of American Pathologists, with modifications undertaken by international expert groups appointed according to ICCR protocols. The dataset for the reporting of renal biopsy for tumour is designed to provide a structured reporting template containing minimum data recording key elements suitable for international use. In formulating the dataset, the ICCR panel incorporated recommendations from the 2012 Vancouver Consensus Conference of the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) and the 2016 edition of the WHO Bluebook on tumours of the urinary and male genital systems. Reporting elements were divided into Required (Core) and Recommended (Non-core) components of the report. Required elements are as follows: specimen laterality, histological tumour type, WHO/ISUP histological tumour grade, sarcomatoid morphology, rhabdoid morphology, necrosis, lymphovascular invasion and coexisting pathology in non-neoplastic kidney. Recommended reporting elements are as follows: operative procedure, tumour site(s), histological tumour subtype and details of ancillary studies. In particular, it is noted that fluorescence in situ hybridisation studies may assist in diagnosing translocation renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and in distinguishing oncocytoma and eosinophilic chromophobe RCC. It is anticipated that the implementation of this dataset into routine clinical practice will facilitate uniformity of pathology reporting worldwide. This, in turn, should have a positive impact on patient treatment and the quality of demographic information held by cancer registries.|Cancer
ID:31302372|Title:Large nested urothelial carcinoma: A clinicopathological study of 22 cases on transurethral resection materials.Abstract:Large nested urothelial carcinoma (LNUC) is a recently recognized variant of urothelial carcinoma (UC), which is characterized with inverted growth pattern and bland cytology. Diagnosis can be extremely challenging, especially in transurethral resection (TUR) materials. Haematoxylin-eosin stained slides of TUR materials with UC, submitted to our department between 2008 and 2017 were re-examined. Twenty-two LNUC cases were found. LNUC frequency was 0.7%. Mean age was 69.9, 82% were male. Mean tumor diameter was 4.9 cm. Non-invasive UC was present in all cases; low-grade in 6, high-grade in 1, low and high-grade in 15. Five and 16 cases were pT1 and pT2, respectively, no invasion was detected in one case. In addition to medium-large nests, small nests and conventional UC areas was present in 2 and 3 cases, respectively. Stroma-tumor interface was irregular in 19 cases and 3 cases had invasive nests with rounded contours. Fibrous stromal reaction and/or stromal lymphoid infiltration were present in 21 cases. Budding, described as small nests in stromal interface of medium-large nests was found in 16 cases. Follow-up was available for 18 cases with an average of 59 months. Four cases had metastasis, 1 patient died of disease. LNUC causes diagnostic difficulty, especially in TUR materials. Large size of tumor, irregularity of nests, presence of stromal reaction and budding can be clues for correct diagnosis.|Cancer
ID:31304427|Title:Pathology of pancreatic cancer.Abstract:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy and estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030. Although overall 5-year survival rates have constantly remained below 10% for the last decades, several key points important for accurate patient stratification have emerged during recent years. These key points include a highly standardized gross examination of PDAC resection specimens, using an axial slicing technique and inking of the circumferential resection margin (CRM), as well as a meticulous microscopic examination, taking into account the prognostic relevance of factors such as the exact resection status (R0 vs. R1 1-mm vs. R1 resection), histopathological tumor grading and the so-called lymph node ratio (LNR). With increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy in PDAC, tumor regression grading (TRG) for PDAC is currently rising in relevance in order to stratify and manage pre-operatively treated PDAC patients. As all current TRG systems for PDAC are unsatisfactory, new standardized international protocols are urgently needed. Several morphological subtypes of PDAC exist, some of which share the same molecular background with classical PDAC, while others are characterized by a distinct molecular pathogenesis. While some show a prognosis similar to classical PDAC, other subtypes stand out due to a better or even worse prognosis than classical PDAC. Prognostic relevant molecular subtypes of PDAC have been proposed as well, however, limitations of used cohorts and the lacking correlation of molecular subtypes with histomorphological subtypes limit the translation of these findings into valuable clinical applications. Lastly, several macroscopic and microscopic precursor lesions of PDAC have been described in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and humans in recent times, providing further insight into PDAC carcinogenesis. In addition, improved diagnosis of PDAC precursors represents a chance to select patients for resection before invasive PDAC is present.|Cancer
ID:31307558|Title:Malignant phyllodes tumor in Lynch syndrome: a case report.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome, or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, is an autosomal dominant genetic syndrome that predisposes individuals to multiple cancer types. The known cancers associated with Lynch syndrome include colorectal and endometrial cancers as well as cancers of the stomach, ovary, urinary tract, hepatobiliary tract, pancreas, small bowel, and brain. There are no searchable cases of malignant phyllodes of the breast associated with Lynch syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 43-year-old Caucasian woman who felt a lump in her left breast and was found to have a spindle cell neoplasm. Definitive surgery revealed a malignant phyllodes tumor. On the basis of her cancer diagnosis and family history of multiple cancers, a Myriad myRisk Hereditary Cancer  test panel of 25 genes was performed. This testing revealed that she had a heterozygous MSH6 mutation as part of the Lynch syndrome panel. Due to positive margins, the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamide. She also had a subsequent total abdominal hysterectomy and a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for risk reduction. She remains in a high-risk surveillance program. Her family members have been tested, which revealed that her two brothers and daughter also carry the genetic mutation. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of genetic testing with rare malignancies because the full scope of phenotypic sequelae for known hereditary syndromes has not been mapped.|Cancer
ID:31309284|Title:Complexity of PEComas : Diagnostic approach, molecular background, clinical management.Abstract:Perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms (PEComas) are a family of mesenchymal neoplasms with features of both melanotic and smooth muscle differentiation. PEComa morphology is highly variable and encompasses epithelioid to spindle cells often with clear cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Molecularly, most PEComas are defined by a loss of function of the TSC1/TSC2 complex. Additionally, a distinct small subset of PEComas harboring rearrangements of the TFE3 (Xp11) gene locus has been identified. By presenting a series of three case reports with distinct features, we demonstrate diagnostic pitfalls as well as the importance of molecular work-up of PEComas because of important therapeutic consequences.|Cancer
ID:31312279|Title:Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer: A Review of the Current Trend in Africa.Abstract:Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and the 11th most common cancer in woman accounting for 6.6% of all cancer cases. Approximately 70-75% bladder cancers are non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). A few African studies have provided considerable rates of NMIBC as compared to western settings 70% to 85%. Critical step in the management of NMIBC is to prevent tumor recurrence which include transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) for staging and histological diagnosis. A second TURBT for high grade tumor, T1 tumors and intravesical adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy are essential to reduce recurrence rate. Nevertheless, variant histology, multiple, progressive and recurrent high-grade tumors are best treated with early radical cystectomy. The African literature is scanty on the management of NMIBC. Most of the histological types are squamous cell bladder cancer and may not conform to transurethral resection only but rather radical cystectomy. Most of these patients are not suitable for any form of treatment as they present with advanced disease. However, there is an increasing incidence of urothelial cancer in Africa over the years due to urbanization. It is best that major investment is made in uro-oncological care to address the growing challenge of these subtypes.|Cancer
ID:31316083|Title:SREBP1-dependent de novo fatty acid synthesis gene expression is elevated in malignant melanoma and represents a cellular survival trait.Abstract:de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (DNFA) is a hallmark adaptation of many cancers that supports survival, proliferation, and metastasis. Here we elucidate previously unexplored aspects of transcription regulation and clinical relevance of DNFA in cancers. We show that elevated expression of DNFA genes is characteristic of many tumor types and correlates with poor prognosis, especially in melanomas. Elevated DNFA gene expression depends on the SREBP1 transcription factor in multiple melanoma cell lines. SREBP1 predominantly binds to the transcription start sites of DNFA genes, regulating their expression by recruiting RNA polymerase II to promoters for productive transcription elongation. We find that SREBP1-regulated DNFA represents a survival trait in melanoma cells, regardless of proliferative state and oncogenic mutation status. Indeed, malignant melanoma cells exhibit elevated DNFA gene expression after the BRAF/MEK signaling pathway is blocked (e.g. by BRAF inhibitors), and DNFA expression remains higher in melanoma cells resistant to vemurafenib treatment than in untreated cells. Accordingly, DNFA pathway inhibition, whether by direct targeting of SREBP1 with antisense oligonucleotides, or through combinatorial effects of multiple DNFA enzyme inhibitors, exerts potent cytotoxic effects on both BRAFi-sensitive and -resistant melanoma cells. Altogether, these results implicate SREBP1 and DNFA enzymes as enticing therapeutic targets in melanomas.|Cancer
ID:31317326|Title:Synchronicity of genetic variants between primary sites and metastatic lymph nodes, and prognostic impact in nodal metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.Abstract:PURPOSE: Nodal positive lung adenocarcinoma includes wide range of survival. Several methods for the classification of nodal-positive lung cancer have been proposed. However, classification considering the impact of targetable genetic variants are lacking. The possibility of genetic variants for the better stratification of nodal positive lung adenocarcinoma was estimated. METHODS: Mutations of 36 genes between primary sites and metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) were compared using next-generation sequencing. Subsequently, mutations in EGFR and BRAF, rearrangements in ALK and ROS1 were evaluated in 69 resected pN1-2M0 adenocarcinoma cases. Recurrence-free survival (RFS), post-recurrence survival (PRS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated with respect to targetable variants and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy after recurrence. RESULTS: About 90% of variants were shared and allele frequencies were similar between primary and metastatic sites. In 69 pN1-2M0 cases, EGFR/ALK were positive in primary sites of 39 cases and same EGFR/ALK variants were confirmed in metastatic LNs of 96.7% tissue-available cases. Multivariate analyses indicated positive EGFR/ALK status was associated with worse RFS (HR 2.366; 95% CI 1.244-4.500; P = 0.009), and PRS was prolonged in cases receiving TKI therapy (no post-recurrence TKI therapies, HR 3.740; 95% CI 1.449-9.650; P = 0.006). OS did not differ with respect to targetable variants or TKI therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Cases harbouring targetable genetic variants had a higher risk of recurrence, but PRS was prolonged by TKI therapy. Classification according to the targetable genetic status provides a basis for predicting recurrence and determining treatment strategies after recurrence.|Cancer
ID:31317679|Title:The role of BRCA1/2 in hereditary and familial breast and ovarian cancers.Abstract:BACKGROUND: BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants have become associated with familial breast and ovarian cancers, and hereditary cancer-predisposition syndrome. With advances in molecular biology, BRCA profiling facilitates early diagnosis and the implementation of preventive and therapeutic strategies. The genes exhibit variable prevalence among different individuals and moderate interpretation complexity. BRCA deficiency is instrumental in cancer development, affects therapeutic options and is instrumental in drug resistance. In addition, BRCA1/2 profile is diverse across different groups and has been associated with the "founder effect" in certain populations. METHODS: In this review, we aim to detail the spectrum of BRCA1/2 variants and their associated risk estimates. RESULTS: The relationship between BRCA1/2 and hereditary and familial cancers is indisputable, yet BRCA screening methods are beset with limitations and lack clinical confidence. CONCLUSION: This review emphasizes the importance of screening BRCA genetics, in addition to their clinical utility. Furthermore, founder variants are anticipated in the Saudi population.|Cancer
ID:31319986|Title:Novel multiplex droplet digital PCR assay for scoring PD-L1 in non-small cell lung cancer biopsy specimens.Abstract:OBJECTIVES: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have become integrated into the clinical management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using RTqPCR, we have previously identified a gene expression panel that detected presence of malignant cells (MMP9:TIMP3 ratio) and quantified PD-L1 transcript levels in small biopsy specimens. However, RTqPCR has diagnostic limitations as it does not generate absolute copy number and is not readily multiplexed. To address this, we have developed a multiplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsies obtained from NSCLC patients (n = 48 adenocarcinoma and n = 40 squamous cell carcinoma) and control lung biopsy specimens (n = 20) were analysed. Absolute MMP9, TIMP3 and PD-L1 transcript copy numbers were determined within a single assay by multiplex ddPCR using Taqman primers and the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Using our optimised triplex ddPCR assay, the MMP9:TIMP3 ratio was significantly elevated in NSCLC biopsies and using a cut-off of >0.028, was 99% (95% CI; 80.5-94.5) sensitive and 80% specific for identifying malignant biopsies. The PD-L1:TIMP3 ratio significantly associated with PD-L1 tumour cell immunohistochemistry staining (r = 0.539, p < 0.0001) and was significantly higher in biopsies with >50% PD-L1 tumour cell staining (p < 0.0001). In summary, a major advantage of our workflow is that it can accurately quantify PD-L1 tumour levels and provide sufficient nucleic acid for screening additional targetable mutations such as EGFR, ALK and ROS1 from a single small biopsy, thereby potentially avoiding the need for re-biopsy. Future studies will need to determine diagnostic ddPCR values that are predictive of clinical response to PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.|Cancer
ID:31320822|Title:Exosomes and Their Role in Cancer Progression.Abstract:Exosomes are a subset of extracellular vesicles and their size is approximately 100 nm in diameter. They are surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane and secreted from almost all of cells. Exosomes are generated within the endocytic system as ILV (intraluminal membrane vesicle) and secreted during the fusion of MVB (multivesicular body) with the cell membrane. Recently it has been reported that exosomes modulate cell-cell communication contributing to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by molecules including exosomes. Moreover, exosomes released from cancer cells are involved in cancer progression. Thus, data regarding the role of the exosomes in malignant cancer will lead to development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods.|Cancer
ID:31321084|Title:NSD1 mutations by HPV status in head and neck cancer: differences in survival and response to DNA-damaging agents.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Compared to HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), HPV-positive HNSCCs are associated with a favorable prognosis in part due to their improved treatment sensitivity. Inactivating mutations in NSD1 were shown to be a favorable prognostic biomarker in laryngeal cancers. Here, we characterize NSD1 mutations from the expanded The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HNSCC cohort (n = 522) and examine their prognostic implications based on HPV status of the tumor. We also begin to examine if NSD1 regulates response to platinum-based drugs and other DNA-damaging agents. METHODS: TCGA HNSCC samples were segregated by HPV and NSD1 mutations using cBioPortal and patient survival was determined. Pathogenicity of mutations was predicted using UMD-Predictor. NSD1-depleted cell lines were established by transfection with control or shRNAs against NSD1, followed by puromycin selection, and confirmed by qRT-PCR. Cell sensitivity to DNA damaging agents was assessed using short-term proliferation and long-term clonogenic survival assays. RESULTS: Among 457 HPV(-) tumors, 13% contained alterations in the NSD1 gene. The majority (61.3%) of NSD1 gene alterations in HPV(-) specimens were truncating mutations within or before the enzymatic SET domain. The remaining alterations included homozygous gene deletions (6.7%), missense point mutations (30.7%) and inframe deletions (1.3%). UMD-Predictor categorized 18 of 23 missense point mutations as pathogenic. For HPV(+) HNSCC (n = 65), 6 NSD1 mutations, comprised of two truncating (33%) and 4 missense point (66%) mutations, were identified. Three of the 4 missense point mutations were predicted to be pathogenic or probably pathogenic by UMD-Predictor. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis determined significantly improved survival of HPV(-) HNSCC patients whose tumors harbored NSD1 gene alterations, as compared to patients with wild-type NSD1 tumors. Interestingly, the survival effect of NSD1 mutations observed in HPV-negative HNSCC was reversed in HPV(+) tumors. Proliferation and clonogenic survival of two HPV(-) cell lines stably expressing control or NSD1 shRNAs showed that NSD1-depleted cells were more sensitive to cisplatin and carboplatin, but not to other DNA damaging drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic alterations in NSD1 hold potential as novel prognostic biomarkers in HPV(-) head and neck cancers. NSD1 mutations in HPV(+) cancers may also play a prognostic role, although this effect must be examined in a larger cohort. NSD1 downregulation results in improved sensitivity to cisplatin and carboplatin, but not to other DNA-damaging agents, in epithelial cells. Increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy agents associated with NSD1 depletion may contribute to improved survival in HPV(-) HNSCCs. Further studies are needed to determine mechanisms through which NSD1 protects HPV(-) HNSCC cells from platinum-based therapy, as well as confirmation of NSD1 effect in HPV(+) HNSCC.|Cancer
ID:31321732|Title:Chronic shisha exposure alters phosphoproteome of oral keratinocytes.Abstract:Shisha smoking has been epidemiologically linked to oral cancer. However, few studies have investigated the pathobiology of shisha-induced cellular transformation. We studied the effects of chronic shisha exposure (8 months) in an in vitro model using immortalized, non-neoplastic oral keratinocytes (OKF6/TERT1). Quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses were performed on OKF6/TERT1 cells treated with shisha extract for a period of 8 months. Pathway analysis was carried out to identify significantly enriched biological processes in shisha-treated cells. Chronic shisha exposure resulted in increased cell scattering phenomenon in OKF6/TERT1 cells. Data analysis revealed differential phosphorylation of 164 peptides (fold change >=1.5, p <= 0.0.5) corresponding to 136 proteins. Proteins associated with mTORC1 and EIF4F complexes involved in initiating protein translation were seen to be enriched upon shisha treatment. Network analysis also highlighted downregulation of proteins involved in Type I interferon signaling in shisha-treated cells. Quantitative phosphoproteomic approach elucidated global perturbations to the molecular milieu of oral keratinocytes upon shisha exposure. Further studies are needed to validate putative targets in oral cancer patients with shisha smoking history.|Cancer
ID:31322271|Title:A germline MBD4 mutation was identified in a patient with colorectal oligopolyposis and early-onset cancer: A case report.Abstract:A 42-year-old woman presented with ~30 adenomatous polyps of the left sided-colon with early rectosigmoid cancer. The patient had no previous medical history and no familial history of inherited colorectal disease. No germline gene mutations associated with colorectal adenomatous polyposis, including APC regulator of WNT signaling pathway, mutY DNA glycosylase, DNA polymerase-epsilon, catalytic subunit, DNA polymerase delta1, catalytic subunit, and mismatch repair genes, were detected via germline genetic testing. A heterozygous germline mutation in methyl-CpG binding domain 4, DNA glycosylase (MBD4), c.217C>T/p.Gln73*, which resulted in the generation of a stop codon, was identified by genetic analyses including whole-exome sequencing. Immunohistochemical staining analysis revealed that the expression of MBD4 protein was absent in the cancer tissue, while it was expressed in the normal epithelium. Sequencing and copy-number analyses demonstrated the loss of the remaining allele of MBD4 in the cancer tissue. Furthermore, somatic mutation signature analysis showed preferential transition of cytosine to thymine residues at CpG dinucleotides in cancer tissues. Although it has been previously reported that germline missense mutations and somatic mutations of MBD4 are associated with the development of colorectal cancer, this is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, in which a germline nonsense mutation of the MBD4 gene has been identified in an early-onset colorectal cancer patient with oligopolyposis.|Cancer
ID:31322508|Title:MORPHOPHENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS OF OVARIAN SEROUS BORDERLINE TUMORS.Abstract:Borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs) represent particular challenge for diagnosis and clinical management as they are characterized with the features of both benign cystadenomas and malignant carcinomas. The aim of our study was to investigate histomorphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of ovarian serous-papillary borderline tumors, compared to serous cystadenomas and low- and high-grade serous carcinomas. Altogether, 80 formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue specimens, distributed in four groups, including serous cystadenoma (group I), serous BOTs (group II), Low (group III) and high (group IV) grade serous carcinomas, were investigated by standard immunohistochemistry, using antibodies against CK7 CK20, WT1, Vimentin, CDX2, CEA, ER, cyclin D1, BCL2, E-cadherin, calretinin, SA125, Ki67, P53. Study results showed, that ovarian serous BOTs are characterized with slightly increase proliferative potential compared to benign cystadenomas, whilst apoptotic potential is retained with the difference from malignant serous carcinomas. p53 mutation is not present, as well as the expression of Vimentin. Overall, ovarian serous BOTs are characterized with highly variable immunohistochemical phenotype and the use of multiple immunohistochemical markers are recommended for the differential diagnosis from low grade serous carcinomas and benign cystadenomas.|Cancer
ID:31327245|Title:[Characteristics and diagnostic applications of circulating cell-free DNA in colorectal cancer].Abstract:The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) are considerably high in Central European countries, it is the second most common cancer in both men and women in Hungary with 10,000 newly registered patients per year. These data indicate the necessity of new screening methods that are more comfortable for patients, hence the compliance can be increased. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) level in blood is elevated in certain physiological conditions, such as pregnancy or high physical activity. Furthermore, cfDNA concentration alterations can also be detected in some pathological processes; increased cfDNA amount was observed in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as in various cancers including CRC. Numerous studies about origin, function, and mechanism of cfDNA can be found in the scientific literature. In this review, we aimed to describe the quantitative and qualitative changes of cfDNA, to present its functions, and to provide an overview of the available diagnostic applications for CRC. CfDNA can be released to the circulatory system via apoptosis, necrosis or by direct secretions by living cells. In cancer patients, cfDNA can originate from healthy and cancer cells, hence genetic (e.g. mutations in APC, KRAS, BRAF) and epigenetic (e.g. methylation in SEPT9, SFRP1) alterations of tumor cells can be examined in cfDNA fraction. Several high-throughput, sensitive and even automated methods are available providing opportunity to perform standardized sample preparation and to analyse biomarker candidates quantitatively. These enhancements can help to develop alternative screening methods that can be easily integrated into the clinical practice and can contribute to early cancer detection.

ID:31330366|Title:Molecular pathogenesis of gallbladder cancer: An update.Abstract:Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is the most aggressive gastrointestinal malignancy throughout the world, with wide geographical variance. It is the subtype of biliary tract malignancy that has the poorest prognosis and lower survival among all biliary tract malignancies. Various factors are associated with GBC pathogenesis such as environmental, microbial, metabolic and molecular. Chronic inflammation of gallbladder due to presence of gallstone or microbial infection (eg. Salmonella or H. pylori) results in sustained production of inflammatory mediators in the tissue microenvironment, which can cause genomic changes linked to carcinogenesis. Genetic alterations are one of the major factors, associated with aggressiveness and prognosis. Researches have been done to explore suitable biomarker for early diagnosis and identify altered molecular pathways to develop appropriate biomarkers for early diagnosis, therapy and predicting prognosis. Different agents for targeted therapy against actionable mutations of molecules like EGFR, VEGF, mTOR, HER2, PDL-1, PD-1, MET, PI3K, N-cadherin, VEGFR, MEK1 and MEK2 are being tried. Despite these advancements, there is dismal improvement in the survival of GBC patients. Genetic aberrations other than actionable mutations and epigenetic modification including aberrant expressions of micro-RNAs, are also being studied both as diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic targets. Complex pathogenesis of GBC still needs to be unfolded. In this review we focus on the molecular pathogenesis of GBC elucidated till date along with future directions that can be explored to achieve better management of GBC patients.|Cancer
ID:31330830|Title:The Molecular Hallmarks of the Serrated Pathway in Colorectal Cancer.Abstract:Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. It includes different subtypes that differ in their clinical and prognostic features. In the past decade, in addition to the conventional adenoma-carcinoma model, an alternative multistep mechanism of carcinogenesis, namely the "serrated pathway", has been described. Approximately, 15 to 30% of all CRCs arise from neoplastic serrated polyps, a heterogeneous group of lesions that are histologically classified into three morphologic categories: hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated adenomas/polyps, and the traditional serrated adenomas/polyps. Serrated polyps are characterized by genetic (BRAF or KRAS mutations) and epigenetic (CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)) alterations that cooperate to initiate and drive malignant transformation from normal colon mucosa to polyps, and then to CRC. The high heterogeneity of the serrated lesions renders their diagnostic and pathological interpretation difficult. Hence, novel genetic and epigenetic biomarkers are required for better classification and management of CRCs. To date, several molecular alterations have been associated with the serrated polyp-CRC sequence. In addition, the gut microbiota is emerging as a contributor to/modulator of the serrated pathway. This review summarizes the state of the art of the genetic, epigenetic and microbiota signatures associated with serrated CRCs, together with their clinical implications.|Cancer
ID:31331345|Title:Subtyping of microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC) generally have a better prognosis than patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC. However, some MSI-H CRC patients do not gain overall survival benefits from immune checkpoint-blockade treatment. In other words, heterogeneity within the subgroup of MSI-H tumors remains poorly understood. Thus, an in-depth molecular characterization of MSI-H tumors is urgently required. METHODS: Here, we use nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based consensus clustering to define CRC MSI-H subtypes in The Cancer Genome Atlas and a French multicenter cohort GSE39582. CIBERSORT was used to calculate the proportions of 22 lymphocytes in tumor tissue in MSI-H subtypes. RESULTS: MSI-H CRC samples basically clustered into two subgroups (MSI-H1 and MSI-H2). MSI-H1 was characterized by a lower BRAF mutational status, higher frequency of chromosomal instability, global hypomethylation, and worse survival than MSI-H2. Further examination of the immune landscape showed that macrophages of the M2 phenotype were enriched in MSI-H1, which may be associated with poor prognosis in this subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the genetic heterogeneity in MSI-H CRCs and macrophages may serve as good targets for anticancer therapy in MSI-H1.|Cancer
ID:31333801|Title:RAG1 high expression associated with IKZF1 dysfunction in adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Abstract:The recombination mediated by recombination activating gene (RAG) is not only the dominant mutational process but also the predominant driver of oncogenic genomic rearrangement in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is further responsible for leukemic clonal evolution. In this study, significant RAG1 increase is observed in the subsets of B-ALL patients, and high expression of RAG1 is observed to be correlated with high proliferation markers. IKZF1-encoded protein, IKAROS, directly binds to the RAG1 promoter and regulates RAG1 expression in leukemic cells. CK2 inhibitor by increasing IKAROS activity significantly suppresses RAG1 expression in ALL in an IKAROS-dependent manner. Patients with IKZF1 deletion have significantly higher expression of RAG1 compared to that without IKZF1 deletion. CK2 inhibitor treatment also results in an increase in IKZF1 binding to the RAG1 promoter and suppression of RAG1 expression in primary ALL cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that RAG1 high expression is associated with high proliferation markers in B-ALL. Our data for the first time proved that RAG1 expression is directly suppressed by IKAROS. Our results also reveal drive oncogenesis of B-ALL is driven by high expression of RAG1 with IKAROS dysfunction together, which have significance in an integrated prognostic model for adult ALL.|Cancer
ID:31334571|Title:Primary malignant epithelioid and rhabdoid tumor of bone harboring ZNF532-NUTM1 fusion: the expanding NUT cancer family.Abstract:NUTM1 gene rearrangement is the genetic hallmark of NUT carcinoma, an aggressive tumor that most commonly affects the thoracic and head and neck regions and often exhibits squamous differentiation. The most common fusion partner gene is BRD4, followed by BRD3 and NSD3. Recently, NUTM1 gene rearrangement has been identified in rare tumors from soft tissues, intracranial locations, and other visceral organs. These tumors often show high grade malignant epithelioid to round cell histomorphology and lack evidence of squamous and/or epithelial differentiation. Therefore, their relationship with classic NUT carcinoma is still uncertain. Here, we present a primary mandible bone tumor of a 21-year-old female exhibiting monotonous epithelioid and rhabdoid cytomorphology, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. The initial immunohistochemical workup was non-specific, showing only CD34 positivity while being negative for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), EMA, p63, etc. INI-1 expression was retained. RNA sequencing was performed and identified a rare ZNF532-NUTM1 gene fusion, which had only been reported in a single case of pulmonary NUT carcinoma. The fusion was confirmed by FISH for NUTM1 gene rearrangement and supported by diffuse and strong NUT immunoreactivity. MYC mRNA up-regulation and immunoreactivity, a common finding in NUT carcinoma, was also observed in this tumor, suggesting a possible common pathogenetic mechanism and potential treatment target. The patient presented with a non-metastatic disease status and received hemimandibulectomy, selective neck dissection (level Ib), and post-operative radiation therapy. She remained disease free 3.6 years after the initial diagnosis.|Cancer
ID:31335678|Title:Evaluating the tumor biology of lung adenocarcinoma: A multimodal analysis.Abstract:We evaluated the relationships among functional imaging modality such as PET-CT and DW-MRI and lung adenocarcinoma pathologic heterogeneity, extent of invasion depth, and tumor cellularity as a marker of tumor microenvironment.In total, 74 lung adenocarcinomas were prospectively included. All patients underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT and MRI before curative surgery. Pathology revealed 68 stage I tumors, 3 stage II tumors, and 3 stage IIIA tumors. Comprehensive histologic subtyping was performed for all surgically resected tumors. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and ADC values were correlated with pathologic grade, extent of invasion, solid tumor size, and tumor cellularity.Mean solid tumor size (low: 1.7 +- 3.0 mm, indeterminate: 13.9 +- 14.2 mm, and high grade: 30.3 +- 13.5 mm) and SUVmax (low: 1.5 +- 0.2, indeterminate: 3.5 +- 2.5, and high grade: 15.3 +- 0) had a significant relationship with pathologic grade based on 95% confidence intervals (P = .01 and P < .01, respectively). SUVmax showed a strong correlation with tumor cellularity (R = 0.713, P < .001), but was not correlated with extent of invasion (R = 0.387, P = .148). A significant and strong positive correlation was observed among SUVmax values and higher cellularity and pathologic grade. ADC did not exhibit a significant relationship with tumor cellularity.Intratumor heterogeneity quantification using a multimodal-multiparametric approach might be effective when tumor volume consists of a real tumor component as well as a non-tumorous stromal component.|Cancer
ID:31335885|Title:Telomere length and its correlation with gene mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in a Korean population.Abstract:Telomere length (TL) is a prognostic indicator in Caucasian chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but its significance in Asian CLL remains unknown. To investigate the prognostic significance of TL and its correlation with cytogenetic aberrations and somatic mutations, we analyzed TL measurements at the cellular level by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in patients with CLL in Korea. The present study enrolled 110 patients (41 females and 69 males) diagnosed with CLL according to the World Health Organization criteria (2001-2017). TLs of bone marrow nucleated cells at the single-cell level were measured by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) in 71 patients. The correlations of TL with clinical characteristics, cytogenetic aberrations, genetic mutations, and overall survival were assessed. The median value of mean TL in CLL patients (T/C ratio 7.46 (range 1.19-18.14) was significantly shorter than that in the normal controls (T/C ratio 15.28 (range 8.59-24.93) (p < 0.001). Shorter TLs were associated with complex karyotypes (p = 0.030), del(11q22) (p = 0.023), presence of deletion and/or mutation in ATM and/or TP53 (p = 0.019), and SH2B3 mutation (p = 0.015). A shorter TL was correlated with lower hemoglobin levels and adverse survival (mean TL < 9.35, p = 0.021). When the proportion of cells with extremely short TLs (< 7.61) was greater than 90%, CLL patients showed poor survival (p = 0.002). Complex karyotypes, TP53 mutation, and the number of mutated genes were determined to be significant adverse variables by multivariable Cox analysis (p = 0.011, p = 0.002, and p = 0.002, respectively). TL was attrited in CLL, and attrited telomeres were correlated with adverse survival and other well-known adverse prognostic factors. We infer that TL is an independent adverse prognostic predictor in Korean CLL.|Cancer
ID:31337986|Title:YAP promotes multi-drug resistance and inhibits autophagy-related cell death in hepatocellular carcinoma via the RAC1-ROS-mTOR pathway.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Multi-drug resistance is the major cause of chemotherapy failure in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). YAP, a critical effector of the Hippo pathway, has been shown to contribute to the progression, metastasis and invasion of cancers. However, the potential role of YAP in mediating drug resistance remains obscure. METHODS: RT-qPCR and western blot were used to assess YAP expression in HCC cell lines. CCK-8 assays, flow cytometry, a xenograft tumour model, immunochemistry and GFP-mRFP-LC3 fusion proteins were utilized to evaluate the effect of YAP on multi-drug resistance, intracellular ROS production and the autophagy of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Autophagy inhibitor and rescue experiments were carried out to elucidate the mechanism by which YAP promotes chemoresistance in HCC cells. RESULTS: We found that BEL/FU, a typical HCC cell line with chemoresistance, exhibited overexpression of YAP. Moreover, the inhibition of YAP by shRNA or verteporfin conferred the sensitivity of BEL/FU cells to chemotherapeutic agents through autophagy-related cell death in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, YAP silencing significantly enhanced autophagic flux by increasing RAC1-driven ROS, which contributed to the inactivation of mTOR in HCC cells. In addition, the antagonist of autophagy reversed the enhanced effect of YAP silencing on cell death under treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that YAP upregulation endowed HCC cells with multi-drug resistance via the RAC1-ROS-mTOR pathway, resulting in the repression of autophagy-related cell death. The blockade of YAP may serve as a promising novel therapeutic strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in HCC.|Cancer
ID:31338587|Title:Acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas with thyroid-like follicular features: first description of a new diagnostic challenging subtype.Abstract:Acinar cell carcinomas (ACCs) of the pancreas are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms showing a wide spectrum of morphological features including acinar, solid, glandular, and trabecular architecture. In addition, uncommon cytological aspects have recently been described and include oncocytic, spindle, clear, and pleomorphic cell types. This wide histological spectrum represents a challenge in the diagnostic task for pathologists. Molecular mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of ACCs are not completely known, but, in general, they differ from those observed in ductal adenocarcinomas or neuroendocrine neoplasms of the pancreas and frequently include alterations in the APC/beta-catenin pathway. In the present paper, we describe a new variant of ACC showing thyroid-like follicular features and CTNNB1 mutation. This phenotype needs to be included in the spectrum of morphological presentation of ACC.|Cancer
ID:31340433|Title:LOXL3 Function Beyond Amino Oxidase and Role in Pathologies, Including Cancer.Abstract:Lysyl oxidase like 3 (LOXL3) is a copper-dependent amine oxidase responsible for the crosslinking of collagen and elastin in the extracellular matrix. LOXL3 belongs to a family including other members: LOX, LOXL1, LOXL2, and LOXL4. Autosomal recessive mutations are rare and described in patients with Stickler syndrome, early-onset myopia and non-syndromic cleft palate. Along with an essential function in embryonic development, multiple biological functions have been attributed to LOXL3 in various pathologies related to amino oxidase activity. Additionally, various novel roles have been described for LOXL3, such as the oxidation of fibronectin in myotendinous junction formation, and of deacetylation and deacetylimination activities of STAT3 to control of inflammatory response. In tumors, three distinct roles were described: (1) LOXL3 interacts with SNAIL and contributes to proliferation and metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells; (2) LOXL3 is localized predominantly in the nucleus associated with invasion and poor gastric cancer prognosis; (3) LOXL3 interacts with proteins involved in DNA stability and mitosis completion, contributing to melanoma progression and sustained proliferation. Here we review the structure, function and activity of LOXL3 in normal and pathological conditions and discuss the potential of LOXL3 as a therapeutic target in various diseases.|Cancer
ID:31340823|Title:Clinicopathological features and prognosis of ciliated muconodular papillary tumor.Abstract:BACKGROUNDS: The pulmonary ciliated muconodular papillary tumor (CMPT) is a very rare tumor with only several case reports in published literatures, and its clinicopathological features, standard treatment methods and prognosis has not been well defined. METHODS: Two cases of CMPT diagnosed and treated in our hospital and 39 cases reported in the published literature were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The cohort of 41 CMPT patients comprised of 20 males and 21 females, aged 9-84 years. The diameter of the primary tumor was 0.3-4.5 cm. Most of these lesions were subsolid nodules, as observed on computed tomography and easily misdiagnosed as early lung adenocarcinoma. Tumors of 26 patients were stained by immunohistochemistry method, which revealed that CK7, CEA, and TTF-1 were positive and CK20 was negative in most patients. The results of gene alternation demonstrated mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF and ALK rearrangements in CMPT. All the patients underwent surgical treatment and did not receive postoperative adjuvant therapy. The follow-up duration was 0-120 months, and no case of tumor recurrence was found until the final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CMPT was low and rate of image misdiagnosis high. Immunohistochemistry is helpful for accurate diagnosis of CMPT. Sub-lobectomy may be proper and adjuvant treatment should be avoided since the disease is now prone to benign lesions. Furthermore, since the biological behavior of this tumor is not yet fully elucidated, additional case data are essential for accurate conclusions.|Cancer
ID:31341365|Title:Histologic features and genomic alterations of primary colorectal adenocarcinoma predict growth patterns of liver metastasis.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Different histological growth patterns (HGPs) of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) liver metastasis are associated with patients' prognosis and response to antiangiogenic therapy. However, the relationship between HGPs of liver metastasis and clinicopathological and genomic characteristics of primary cancer has not been well established. AIM: To assess whether certain clinicopathological and genomic features of primary CRC could predict the HGPs of liver metastasis. METHODS: A total of 29 patients with paired resections of both primary CRC and liver metastasis were divided into two groups: A (15 cases with desmoplastic liver metastasis) and B (14 cases with replacement liver metastasis). Clinical information was obtained from patients' charts. Mismatch repair proteins, BRAFV600E, and PD-L1 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Five cases were selected randomly from each group for whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis. RESULTS: In the primary tumor, expanding growth pattern, low tumor budding score (TBS), and Crohn's disease-like response (CDR) were associated with desmoplastic liver metastasis and better overall survival, whereas infiltrating growth pattern alone of primary carcinoma could predict the replacement liver metastasis and worse overall survival (P < 0.05). On WES analysis, primary carcinoma with desmoplastic liver metastasis showed mutations in APC (4/5); TP53 (3/5); KRAS, PIK3CA, and FAT4 (2/5); BRCA-1, BRCA2, BRAF, and DNAH5 (1/5), whereas primary carcinoma with replacement liver metastasis showed mutations in APC and TP53 (3/5); KRAS, FAT4, DNH5, SMAD, ERBB2, ERBB3, LRP1, and SDK1 (1/5). CONCLUSION: The HGPs, TBS, and CDR of primary CRC as well as the presence of specific genetic mutations such as those in PIK3CA could be used to predict the HGPs of liver metastasis, response to therapy, and patients' prognosis.|Cancer

ID:31341686|Title:Hepatic YAP1-TFE3 Rearranged Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma.Abstract:Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is an uncommon low-grade malignant vascular tumor that may arise in soft tissue/bone or visceral sites such as the liver and lung. As this tumor exhibits epithelioid morphology, it frequently causes diagnostic confusion with other epithelioid vascular neoplasms as well as carcinoma. While 90% of classic EHE are driven by a WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion gene, a histologically distinctive subset of EHE has been recently shown to harbor a different fusion gene, YAP1-TFE3. This variant is likely underrecognized given its rarity and only recent description. Notably, EHE frequently involves the liver but only one case of hepatic YAP1-TFE3 rearranged EHE has been reported to date. We present the second case of YAP1-TFE3 rearranged EHE affecting a 65-year-old woman and presenting as multiple liver masses, with characterization of the fusion gene at the transcriptomic and genomic levels. There are several educational points noted from this case. YAP1-TFE3 rearranged EHE shows distinctly vasoformative foci, unlike classic EHE and mimicking angiosarcoma or epithelioid hemangioma. The tumors cells show a histiocytoid appearance with voluminous cytoplasm, similar to other TFE3-rearranged tumors. Finally, in the liver, this tumor may in part mimic focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver which is an underrecognized diagnostic pitfall. This report highlights the key diagnostic and genetic features of this newly recognized variant of hepatic EHE to aid pathologists in appropriately classifying these tumors.|Cancer
ID:31347028|Title:Clinical Evaluation of IntelliPlex  KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit for Detection of KRAS Mutations in Codon 12 and 13: A Novel Multiplex Approach.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most frequently occurring cancers worldwide and its incidence is forecasted to increase. Testing for KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) mutations in colorectal tissue biopsy samples has become a crucial tool to guide therapeutic decisions for personalized treatment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the IntelliPlex  KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit using clinical specimens compared to Sanger sequencing as the reference method. METHODS: A total of 248 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples, with CRC tumors comprising more than 10% of the whole tissue sample, were included in the study and analyzed for specific KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13. For samples with discordant results between Sanger sequencing and the IntelliPlex  KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit, Pyrosequencing was utilized to resolve the KRAS mutational status. RESULTS: Sequencing determined 153 specimens as KRAS wild-type genotype while the IntelliPlex  KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit confirmed 139 of the wild-type cases, resulting in a clinical specificity of 90.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 85.12-94.91). All 95 specimens with a reported mutation in codons 12 or 13 of KRAS by sequencing were also reported as non-wild-type by the IntelliPlex  KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit, resulting in a clinical sensitivity to detect KRAS mutations of 100% (95% CI 96.19-100). CONCLUSIONS: The IntelliPlex  KRAS G12/13 Mutation Kit demonstrates suitable specificity and sensitivity for use in clinical laboratories to determine the mutational status of KRAS codons 12 and 13.|Cancer
ID:31348551|Title:High incidence of MYC rearrangement in human immunodeficiency virus-positive plasmablastic lymphoma.Abstract:AIMS: MYC rearrangements are the main cytogenetic alterations in plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL). We aimed to investigate the relationship between MYC rearrangement and the clinicopathological features of PBL. METHODS AND RESULTS: MYC rearrangements assessed in 13 unpublished single-centre PBL cases, and an additional 85 cases from the literature, with reported MYC rearrangement information individualised by patient, were reviewed. In Asia, PBL was much less commonly diagnosed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients (27% versus 84%, P = 0.000), with older age (median age at diagnosis: 52 years versus 44 years, P = 0.046) and a lower EBV infection rate (56.8% versus 81.8%, P = 0.049), than in non-Asian regions. Overall, MYC rearrangements were identified in 44 of 98 (44.9%) PBL cases, and IGH was the partner in almost all available cases (30/31, 96.8%), as confirmed with a MYC-IGH fusion probe. The MYC rearrangement rate in HIV-positive cases (33/55, 60.0%) was significantly higher than that in HIV-negative cases (11/38, 28.9%, P = 0.003). Patients with MYC rearrangement showed a trend towards an inferior median survival time (9.6 months versus 15.7 months, P = 0.122) and 2-year overall survival (17% versus 32%, P = 0.238). CONCLUSIONS: MYC rearrangement was frequently identified in PBL patients, and IGH was the partner gene in an overwhelming majority of MYC rearrangements. In addition, the MYC rearrangement rate was significantly higher in HIV-positive PBL patients than that in HIV-negative patients. MYC rearrangement may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV-positive PBL, but further studies are required to understand the underlying mechanisms.|Cancer
ID:31350202|Title:Next Generation Sequencing Reveals Novel Mutations in Mismatch Repair Genes and Other Cancer Predisposition Genes in Asian Patients with Suspected Lynch Syndrome.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Although at least 5 genes are implicated in Lynch Syndrome (LS), up to 50% of suspected cases are owing to undefined genes. We utilized next generation sequencing (NGS) to characterize the mutation profile of patients with cancer (CA) suspected to have LS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 174 Asian patients with CA from our CA Genetics Clinic from 2000 to 2014 suspected to have LS, and obtained germline DNA for NGS using TruSight Cancer. Frameshift, nonsense, and known deleterious mutations were considered pathogenic. Polymorphisms <= 1% frequency in 1000 Genomes (Asian) were classified using established databases. RESULTS: Of the 174 probands, 80.5% were Chinese, the median age at CA diagnosis was 45 years (range, 18-82 years), and 84.5% and 8.6% had colon and LS-like CA, respectively. Forty-seven of 100 evaluable colon CA probands had LS-like histopathologic features. Nineteen of 174 had family history fulfilling Amsterdam I/II Criteria, whereas the rest fulfilled Bethesda Guidelines. Thirty-one of 174 harbored pathogenic mutations with 10 in LS genes only, 20 in non-LS genes only, and 1 in both. Of the 11 with LS gene mutations, MLH1 was most commonly involved (n = 7), followed by MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Nine of 174 had pathogenic mutations diagnostic of alternative hereditary syndromes including 2 each in CDH1, APC, and BRCA1, and 1 each in BRCA2, SMAD4, and MUTYH. Ten unique mutations were detected in low-to-moderate penetrance genes: 6 individuals had a recurring novel KIT:c.2836C>T nonsense mutation (n = 3) or ERCC4:c.2169C>A nonsense mutation (n = 3) without LS gene mutation, which is of clinical interest. CONCLUSIONS: In this Asian study, NGS proved to be feasible in screening for causative mutations in patients with CA suspected to have LS.|Cancer
ID:31350313|Title:Parallel Analyses of Somatic Mutations in Plasma Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) and Matched Tumor Tissues in Early-Stage Breast Cancer.Abstract:PURPOSE: Early detection and intervention can decrease the mortality of breast cancer significantly. Assessments of genetic/genomic variants in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have generated great enthusiasm for their potential application as clinically actionable biomarkers in the management of early-stage breast cancer.Experimental Design: In this study, 861 serial plasma and matched tissue specimens from 102 patients with early-stage breast cancer who need chemotherapy and 50 individuals with benign breast tumors were deeply sequenced via next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques using large gene panels. RESULTS: Cancer tissues in this cohort of patients showed profound intratumor heterogeneities (ITHGs) that were properly reflected by ctDNA testing. Integrating the ctDNA detection rate of 74.2% in this cohort with the corresponding predictive results based on Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System classification (BI-RADS) could increase the positive predictive value up to 92% and potentially dramatically reduce surgical overtreatment. Patients with positive ctDNA after surgery showed a higher percentage of lymph node metastasis, indicating potential recurrence and remote metastasis. The ctDNA-positive rates were significantly decreased after chemotherapy in basal-like and Her2+ tumor subtypes, but were persistent despite chemotherapy in luminal type. The tumor mutation burden in blood (bTMB) assessed on the basis of ctDNA testing was positively correlated with the TMB in tumor tissues (tTMB), providing a candidate biomarker warranting further study of its potentials used for precise immunotherapy in cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These data showed that ctDNA evaluation is a feasible, sensitive, and specific biomarker for diagnosis and differential diagnosis of patients with early-stage breast cancer who need chemotherapy.|Cancer
ID:31351510|Title:Giant Lumbar Polypoid Tumor with Bullae on its Surface.Abstract:Dear Editor, Acrochordons are common benign neoplasms found in everyday practice. We present a rare case of a giant and single acrochordon on the lumbar region with signs of ischemia. The correlation of clinical, dermatoscopic, and histopathological analyses may help the clinician differentiate this entity from other benign and malignant dermatoses. A 33-year-old man presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of a lumbar mass that had been growing for two years. The lesion was asymptomatic except for recent discomfort when lying in the supine decubitus position. On examination there was a single, erythematous, non-tender pedunculated lesion, 5.1 cm x 4 cm x 3.2 cm in size, with flaccid bullae on its surface and firm consistency (Figure 1, a-b). Dermoscopy showed regularly arranged dotted vessels in a violaceous background and bullae filled with serous fluid (Figure 1, c-d). His personal and family medical history were unremarkable. Shave excision was performed and the sample was sent for histopathologic analysis. Histopathology revealed a normal epidermis surrounding a core of loose collagen fibers. Papillary dermis showed a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, congested capillaries, and extravasated erythrocytes. Scattered clusters of adipocytes were found in the deep dermis (Figure 2). The diagnosis of a giant ischemic acrochordon was established. Acrochordons, also commonly known as skin tags, are benign pedunculated neoplasms frequently found on the neck, axillae, or groin. They represent fibroepithelial polyps that originate from ectoderm and mesoderm tissue (1). They can be pigmented or skin colored and usually range between 2 to 5 mm in size. Skin tags can affect nearly 46% of the general population (2). Giant and solitary acrochordons are an uncommon clinical variant (2). Differential diagnosis of this pathology may be challenging in the particular clinical context of this patient. Benign neoplasms such as dermatofibroma, neurofibroma, and epidermal inclusion cysts can be clinically similar to giant skin tags (1,2). Histopathological analyses of acrochordons usually show papillomatosis, irregular acanthosis, loose collagen fibers, and dilated capillaries (2). A fibrolipomatous variant of acrochordon may reveal adipose tissue lobules between septa of collagen on pathological examination (1). Local ischemia due to twisting of the stalk may induce the formation of intradermal or subepidermal blisters in these tumors. Histopathologic characteristics found in ischemic acrochordons are neutrophil infiltration, congested capillaries, and extravasated erythrocytes (3). Fibroepithelioma of Pinkus (FeP) is a rare variant of basal cell carcinoma that may clinically mimic benign polypoid tumors and has a certain predilection for the lumbosacral area. Dermoscopic characteristics of fibroepithelioma of Pinkus that may aid the clinician in this diagnosis are fine arborizing vessels, either alone or associated with dotted vessels, and white streaks (4). Cosmetically adequate treatment of a giant acrochordon can be performed by shave excision and electrodesiccation of its pedicle. Choudhary et al. reported good results with this technique on a giant acrochordon on the thigh (5).|Cancer
ID:31354263|Title:Photothermal effects of NaYF4:Yb,Er@PE3@Fe3O4 superparamagnetic nanoprobes in the treatment of melanoma.Abstract:Objective: The study aimed to synthesize superparamagnetic NaYF4:Yb,Er@PE3@Fe3O4 upconversion nanoprobes and to study their photothermal effects for the treatment of malignant melanoma. Methods: Morphological characteristics of the synthesized nanoprobes were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Their biocompatibility and biodistribution profiles were assessed through blood routine/biochemistry tests and the inductively coupled plasma/optical emission spectrometry-based analysis of tissue metal elements. Their photothermal conversion efficiency and their potential as contrast agents for upconversion luminescence (UCL)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dual-modal imaging were tested. Efficacy in photothermal therapy, which was achieved by combining nanoprobes with near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, was evaluated in both A375 cell line and BALB/c mice models. The underlying mechanisms were interrogated by molecular approaches including the MTT assay, flow cytometry, semiquantitative PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Results: 1) Our synthesized NaYF4:Yb,Er@PE3@Fe3O4 nanoprobes exhibited a uniform cubic morphology with a diameter of ~50 nm. Subcutaneous administration led to no severe, long-lasting adverse effects in mice, possibly due to complete removal of these nanomaterials within one month. 2) Our nanoprobes possessed superior photothermal conversion efficiency and strong contrasting effects during UCL/MRI dual-modal imaging, corroborating their applications in imaging-guided photothermal therapy. 3) Combinatorial treatment of these nanoprobes with NIR irradiation induced profound apoptosis/necrosis in A375 cells. Similarly, the same treatment modality led to strong therapeutic effects in BALB/c mice implanted with A375 tumor xenografts. Mechanistic studies suggested an involvement of heat shock protein 70 in mediating the observed antitumor effects of our nanoprobes. Conclusion: Our study describes a convenient method to synthesize a new type of superparamagnetic upconversion nanoprobes, which possess high biocompatibility and can be used in imaging-guided photothermal therapy for the treatment of malignant melanoma. Importantly, our findings will promote clinical applications of NaYF4:Yb,Er@PE3@Fe3O4 as novel theranostic agents in treating melanoma and many other tumors.|Cancer
ID:31355228|Title:Prognostic significance of the PANK family expression in acute myeloid leukemia.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogenous hematological malignancy and its prognostication depends on the genetic mutation and expression profile of each patient. Pantothenate kinase (PANK) is a regulatory enzyme that controls coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. It has four isoforms encoded by PANK1-4, respectively. Whether the expression of the PANK family has prognostic significance in AML remains unclear. METHODS: We screened The Cancer Genome Atlas database for AML patients with complete PANK1-4 expression data. Eighty-four AML patients met the criteria and were included in this study. Clinical characteristics at diagnosis, including peripheral blood (PB) white blood cell counts (WBC), blast percentages in PB and bone marrow (BM), French-American-British (FAB) subtypes and the frequencies of common genetic mutations were described. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were constructed for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), using a limited backward elimination procedure. RESULTS: Patients with high PANK2 expression had significantly longer event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients with low PANK2 expression (P=0.007, P=0.016, respectively), whereas patients with high PANK4 expression had shorter EFS and OS than patients with low PANK4 expression (P=0.022, P=0.015, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed that high PANK4 expression was an independent risk factor for EFS and OS (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that high PANK2 expression might have favorable effects on AML, while high PANK4 expression was indicative of poor prognosis.|Cancer
ID:31366136|Title:Early Colorectal Cancers Provide New Evidence for a Lynch Syndrome-to-CMMRD Phenotypic Continuum.Abstract:Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome, caused by heterozygous mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Biallelic mutations in these genes lead however, to constitutive mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD). In this study, we follow the diagnostic journey of a 12-year old patient with CRC, with a clinical phenotype overlapping CMMRD. We perform molecular and functional assays to discard a CMMRD diagnosis then identify by exome sequencing and validation in a cohort of 134 LS patients, a candidate variant in the MLH1 UTR region in homozygosis. We propose that this variant, together with other candidates, could be responsible for age-of-onset modulation. Our data support the idea that low-risk modifier alleles may influence early development of cancer in LS leading to a LS-to-CMMRD phenotypic continuum. Therefore, it is essential that larger efforts are directed to the identification and study of these genetic modifiers, in order to provide optimal cancer prevention strategies to these patients.|Cancer
ID:31367542|Title:Molecular testing strategies in non-small cell lung cancer: optimizing the diagnostic journey.Abstract:Molecular testing identifies patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who may benefit from targeted therapy or immunotherapy (i.e., immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair-deficient tumors). Current guidelines state that molecular testing should be conducted at the time of initial diagnosis and tumor progression on targeted therapy. In real-world clinical practice in the United States (US), molecular testing is often not conducted or happens late in the diagnostic journey, resulting in delayed or inappropriate treatment. Herein, we review the rationale for molecular testing in advanced NSCLC, along with best-practice guidelines based on published recommendations and our own clinical experience, including a case study. We propose three strategies to optimize molecular testing in newly diagnosed patients with advanced NSCLC: (I) pulmonologists, interventional radiologists, or thoracic surgeons order molecular tests as soon as advanced NSCLC with an adenocarcinoma component is suspected; (II) liquid biopsies conducted early in the diagnostic pathway; and (III) pathologist-directed reflex testing, as conducted in other areas of oncology. To help facilitate these strategies, we outline our recommendations for optimal sample collection techniques and stewardship. In summary, we believe that implementation of these individual strategies will allow clinicians to effectively leverage available treatment options for advanced NSCLC, reducing the time to optimal treatment and improving patient outcomes.|Cancer
ID:31367627|Title:Multimodality-imaging manifestations of primary renal-allograft synovial sarcoma: First case report and literature review.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Primary renal synovial sarcoma (PRSS) is an extremely rare tumor with a poor prognosis. Its imaging and immunohistochemical characteristics may overlap with other renal tumors, which renders its early diagnosis in a dilemma. The diagnosis of primary renal synovial sarcoma requires histopathology and the confirmation of SYT-SSX gene fusion using molecular techniques. Cases of primary renal synovial sarcoma have been previously reported in the literature. However, to our knowledge, primary renal allograft synovial sarcoma was never described. CASE SUMMARY: A 43-year-old male patient who underwent kidney transplantation 9 months ago came to our hospital for regular follow-up. Traditional ultrasonography revealed multiple hypo-echo neoplasms in the renal allograft. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) showed slightly hyper-density masses with slow homogeneous enhancement. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was conducted for accurate pathological diagnosis. The neoplasms were diagnosed as synovial sarcoma by pathological, immunohistochemical, and genetic analyses. Positron emission tomography/CT showed no evidence of metastasis. At approximately one week post biopsy, contrast-enhanced ultrasound was conducted to eliminate active hemorrhage. One month later, CECT showed that the biggest neoplasm grew from 3.3 cm to 5.7 cm in diameter. Parametric imaging was conducted with SonoLiver CAP to conduct further quantitative analysis, which showed that the enhancement pattern was heterogeneous hyper-vascular enhancement. Radical surgical resection of the whole renal allograft and ureter was conducted without additional adjuvant chemotherapy or external radiotherapy. Anlotinib was chosen for targeted therapy with a good response. CONCLUSION: We propose multimodality imaging for accurate diagnosis of renal allograft synovial sarcoma especially when it is formed by spindle-shaped cells.|Cancer
ID:31368038|Title:Clinical applications of (epi)genetics in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: Moving towards liquid biopsies.Abstract:High-throughput analysis, including next-generation sequencing and microarrays, have strongly improved our understanding of cancer biology. However, genomic data on rare cancer types, such as neuroendocrine neoplasms, has been lagging behind. Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) develop from endocrine cells spread throughout the body and are highly heterogeneous in biological behavior. In this challenging disease, there is an urgent need for new therapies and new diagnostic, prognostic, follow-up and predictive biomarkers to aid patient management. The last decade, molecular data on neuroendocrine neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, termed gastroenteropancreatic NENs (GEP-NENs), has strongly expanded. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the recent advances on (epi)genetic level and highlight their clinical applications to address the current needs in GEP-NENs. We illustrate how molecular alterations can be and are being used as therapeutic targets, how mutations in DAXX/ATRX and copy number variations could be used as prognostic biomarkers, how far we are in identifying predictive biomarkers and how genetics can contribute to GEP-NEN classification. Finally, we discuss recent studies on liquid biopsies in the field of GEP-NENs and illustrate how liquid biopsies can play a role in patient management. In conclusion, molecular studies have suggested multiple potential biomarkers, but further validation is ongoing.|Cancer
ID:31371806|Title:Myeloid neoplasms in the setting of sickle cell disease: an intrinsic association with the underlying condition rather than a coincidence; report of 4 cases and review of the literature.Abstract:Myeloid neoplasms occasionally occur in patients with sickle cell disease, and the underlying connection between the two diseases is unclear. Herein, we retrospectively analyzed four cases of sickle cell disease patients who developed myeloid neoplasm. Age at time of diagnosis ranged from 27 to 59 years with a median of 35.5 years. Two patients were treated with hydroxyurea and the other two with supportive care alone, with one out of the four patients receiving additional treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Three patients presented with leukocytosis, and the remaining patient presented with pancytopenia. Two patients were diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm, one with myelodysplastic syndrome, and the other with acute myeloid leukemia. All four cases demonstrated certain degrees of myelodysplasia and complex cytogenetic abnormalities with - 7/7q- and/or - 5/5q- or with 11q23 (KMT2A) rearrangement. This cytogenetic profile resembles that seen in therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, suggesting that myeloid neoplasm in the setting of sickle cell disease may represent a subcategory of the disease distinct from de novo myeloid neoplasm in general. Extensive literature review further demonstrates this similarity in cytogenetic profile, as well as in other associated pathologic features. Potential etiology includes therapy for sickle cell disease, disease-related immunomodulation, or disease-related chronic inflammation. We hypothesize that constant hematopoietic hyperplasia, stimulated by a hemolysis-induced cytokine storm, may increase the chance of somatic mutations/cytogenetic aberrations, resulting in transformation of myeloid precursors. This group of myeloid neoplasms seems to herald a dismal clinical outcome, with median survival <1 year, although the exact pathogenesis and biology of the disease remain to be investigated by large cohorts in future studies.|Cancer
ID:31372496|Title:Clinicopathological and epidemiological significance of breast cancer subtype reclassification based on p53 immunohistochemical expression.Abstract:TP53 mutations are common in breast cancer and are typically associated with more aggressive tumor characteristics, but little is known about the clinicopathological and epidemiological relevance of p53 protein expression, a TP53 mutation surrogate, in breast cancer subtypes. In this study of 7226 Chinese women with invasive breast cancer, we defined breast cancer subtypes using immunohistochemical (IHC) measures of hormone receptors and HER2 in conjunction with histologic grade. p53 expression status was then used to further stratify subtypes into p53-positive and p53-negative. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in case-only logistic regression analyses were used to examine heterogeneity across different subtypes. The frequency of p53 protein expression varied by breast cancer subtype, being lowest in the luminal A-like and highest in the triple-negative and HER2-enriched subtypes (P-value < 0.01). In luminal A-like and B-like/HER2-negative subtypes, p53 positivity was associated with early-onset tumors, high grade, high proliferative index, and basal marker (CK5/6 and EGFR) expression. Further, compared with luminal A-like/p53-negative patients, A-like/p53-positive patients were more likely to be parous [adjusted OR parous vs. nulliparous = 2.67 (1.60, 4.51); P-value < 0.01] and to have breastfed [adjusted OR ever vs. never = 1.38 (1.03, 1.85); P-value = 0.03]. p53 positivity was not associated with examined clinical and risk factors in other tumor subtypes. Overall, these findings suggest that p53 expression, which is readily available in many settings, can be used to identify phenotypes of luminal A-like breast cancer with distinct clinical and epidemiological implications.|Cancer
ID:31372733|Title:[Hereditary colon cancer in Lynch syndrome/HNPCC syndrome in Germany].Abstract:BACKGROUND: Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch/HNPCC syndrome) is based on a germline mutation inducing increased occurrence of colorectal cancer and extracolonic carcinomas in young age. The German HNPCC consortium aims to increase awareness for detection of hereditary colon cancer among patients and physicians. OBJECTIVES: Reliable detection of HNPCC patients is based on a thorough documentation of patients' medical history and on further diagnostics delivered by human genetics and surgical pathology. This manuscript presents a standardized diagnostic concept. METHODS: Relevant literature is reviewed and discussed and diagnostic parameters are outlined. In addition, operating figures of the German HNPCC consortium are presented. RESULTS: The German HNPCC consortium is based on an efficient cooperation between clinical physicians, human geneticists, and surgical pathologists. After a funding period from the Deutsche Krebshilfe, HNPCC diagnostics and preventive medical examinations were transferred into standard care in Germany. In total, 5770 families (8873 patients) were included in HNPCC diagnostics. To date, in 1296 families, mutations of the MLH1-, MSH2-, MSH6-, PMS2-, or EPCAM-gene have been detected. Furthermore, 612 pathogenic variants and 325 variants of unknown significance were found. CONCLUSIONS: Reliable detection of HNPCC patients is based on a standardized diagnostic concept, which has been established within the German HNPCC consortium.|Cancer
ID:31372940|Title:Clinical Implications of Chromosomal Instability (CIN) and Kinetochore Abnormalities in Breast Cancers.Abstract:Genetic instability is a defining property of cancer cells and is the basis of various lesions including point mutations, copy number alterations and translocations. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is part of the genetic instability of cancer and consists of copy number alterations in whole or parts of cancer cell chromosomes. CIN is observed in differing degrees in most cancers. In breast cancer, CIN is commonly part of the genomic landscape of the disease and has a higher incidence in aggressive sub-types. Tumor suppressors that are commonly mutated or disabled in cancer, such as p53 and pRB, play roles in protection against CIN, and as a result, their dysfunction contributes to the establishment or tolerance of CIN. Several structural and regulatory proteins of the centromeres and kinetochore, the complex structure that is responsible for the correct distribution of genetic material in the daughter cells during mitosis, are direct or, mostly, indirect transcription targets of p53 and pRB. Thus, despite the absence of structural defects in genes encoding for centromere and kinetochore components, dysfunction of these tumor suppressors may have profound implications for the correct function of the mitotic apparatus contributing to CIN. CIN and its prognostic and therapeutic implications in breast cancer are discussed in this article.|Cancer

We aimed to evaluate the multivariate effect of TNF-alpha rs361525, rs1800750, rs1800629, IL-10 rs1800896, rs1800872, IL-6 rs1800795, TGF-beta1 rs1800470, IFN-gamma rs2430561 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on AML risk, the multivariate effect of SNPs on overall survival (OS) in AML and the association between the investigated SNPs and prognostic factors in AML. METHODS: All SNPs were genotyped in 226 adult AML cases and 406 healthy individuals. AML patients were investigated for FLT3 (ITD, D835), DNMT3A (R882), and NPM1 type A mutations. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that age above 65 years had a negative influence on survival (P < .001). The presence of the rs1800750 variant genotype (P = .005) or FLT3-ITD mutation (P = .009) in a cytogenetic high-risk group (P = .003) negatively influenced OS. A negative association was observed between Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group Scale status > 2, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, platelet (PLT) count <40 000 cells/mm3 , and OS. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the presence of the rs1800750 variant genotype was a risk factor for death (P = .007), and that blast percentage, LDH level (>=600 IU/L), and cytogenetic high-risk were independent significant predictors for death in AML (P = .04, corrected HR = 1.20; P = .022, corrected HR = 1.24; P = .021, corrected HR = 1.34, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Age above 65 years, PLT count, TNF-alpha rs1800750 variant genotype, blast percentage, LDH level, and cytogenetic high-risk may be used as independent risk factors to assess AML mortality.|Cancer
ID:31378236|Title:Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Epidemiology, Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment.Abstract:Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. In the past decade, significant advances have been made in the science of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Screening has been introduced with the goal of early detection. The National Lung Screening Trial found a lung cancer mortality benefit of 20% and a 6.7% decrease in all-cause mortality with the use of low-dose chest computed tomography in high-risk individuals. The treatment of lung cancer has also evolved with the introduction of several lines of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and NTRK mutations. Similarly, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically changed the landscape of NSCLC treatment. Furthermore, the results of new trials continue to help us understand the role of these novel agents and which patients are more likely to benefit; ICIs are now part of the first-line NSCLC treatment armamentarium as monotherapy, combined with chemotherapy, or after definite chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC. Expression of programmed cell death protein-ligand 1 in malignant cells has been studied as a potential biomarker for response to ICIs. However, important drawbacks exist that limit its discriminatory potential. Identification of accurate predictive biomarkers beyond programmed cell death protein-ligand 1 expression remains essential to select the most appropriate candidates for ICI therapy. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the proper sequence and combinations of these new agents; however, the field is moving rapidly, and the overall direction is optimistic.|Cancer
ID:31383941|Title:APC transcription studies and molecular diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis.Abstract:Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is characterised by the development of hundreds to thousands of colorectal adenomas and results from inherited or somatic mosaic variants in the APC gene. Index patients with suspected FAP are usually investigated by APC coding region sequence and dosage analysis in a clinical diagnostic setting. The identification of an APC variant which is predicted to alter protein function enables predictive genetic testing to guide the management of family members. This report describes a 4-generation family with a phenotype consistent with FAP, but in which an APC variant had not been identified, despite testing. To explore this further, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was employed to assess APC transcription, demonstrating reduced levels of APC RNA. Next generation sequencing (NGS) identified the APC 5'UTR/ Exon 1 variant, c.-190 G>A, that had been reported previously in an another FAP family with APC allelic imbalance. Quantitative RNA studies and DNA sequencing of the APC promoters/ Exon 1 may be useful diagnostically for patients with suspected FAP when coding region variants cannot be identified.|Cancer

CMV-PTC can be associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal-dominant polyposis syndrome caused by a mutation in the APC gene that leads to a disruption of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Understanding the relation between CMV-PTC and FAP is a diagnostic tool for both pathologists and clinicians, because FAP has several implications for patients and their families.|Cancer
ID:31384696|Title:The link between colon cancer and congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE).Abstract:PURPOSE: Clarify the differences between Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)-associated Congenital Hypertrophy of the Retinal Epithelium (CHRPE) and benign variants with regards to lesion characteristics and associated risk. OBSERVATIONS: An eighteen-year-old man with no past medical history was found to have multiple lesions in both eyes that were consistent with FAP-associated CHRPE. Although family history was negative for colon cancer, a colonoscopy was performed, and hundreds of polyps were found extending from the rectum to the distal colon with pathological findings of tubular adenoma. Genetic testing was consistent with a possible de novo Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) mutation. CONCLUSIONS: FAP is an autosomal dominant syndrome that causes colorectal cancer by age thirty-five in ninety-five percent of cases. There has been no established relationship between the benign variants of CHRPE and FAP, and patients with benign variants have no increased risk of colon cancer. While the lack of distinction in nomenclature and similar lesion appearance often leads to misdiagnosis and overtreatment, there are distinct ocular exam features that can provide the correct diagnosis. The exam findings that distinguish FAP-associated CHRPE lesions are (1) bilateralism, (2) occurrence in multiple quadrants, (3) pisiform shape, and (4) irregular borders. Knowing these features can be of great aid, especially in the setting of suspected de novo Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.|Cancer
ID:31385070|Title:Sarcoma with MGA-NUTM1 fusion in the lung: an emerging entity.Abstract:We here document a sarcoma with a recently reported MGA-NUTM1 fusion. A 49-year-old man presented with a nodule in the right lung, which grew to a giant mass in 5 years. The tumor showed uniform oval to spindle cell proliferation in a hypervascular stroma, associated with focal myxoid change and peculiar collagen deposition resembling an osteoid. The tumor showed an undifferentiated phenotype, including negativity for cytokeratin, although it was immunoreactive to BCOR and MUC4, and was initially suspected as BCOR-associated sarcoma. After complete resection, the tumor recurred in the mediastinal lymph node, and the patient died of the disease. RNA sequencing detected MGA (exon 22)-NUTM1 (exon 3), which was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Sanger sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and NUT immunohistochemistry. Clinicopathological features of the present case were similar to some of the reported cases of MGA-NUTM1 sarcomas, suggesting the emergence of a distinct tumor subtype.|Cancer
ID:31400126|Title:[The value of detecting MLL gene rearrangement in children with acute monocytic leukemia].Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of detecting the rearrangement of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene in children with acute mononuclear leukemia (AML). METHODS: Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe was used to detect MLL gene rearrangement in 68 children with AML by interphase FISH. The results were compared with that of conventional G banding chromosomal analysis. RESULTS: Among the 68 children, 28 were detected by FISH with positive hybridization signals, with a detection rate for MLL gene rearrangement being 41.2%. Twelve (17.6%) reciprocal translocations and interruption of 11q23 were detected by G banding analysis. The difference in the detection rates between the two methods was statistically significant (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of FISH assay for MLL gene rearrangement was significantly higher than that of G banding chromosomal karyotyping. Combined use of both methods for children with AML can improve the detection rate of MLL gene rearrangements and provide crucial clues for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.|Cancer
ID:31404155|Title:Helical and kinase domain mutations of PIK3CA, and their association with hormone receptor expression in breast cancer.Abstract:Breast cancer is one of the major causes of female morbidity and mortality, accounting for ~25% of the total cancer cases in women. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic alpha subunit (PIK3CA) mutations serve a major role in downstream signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases. The present study aimed to elucidate the frequency of exon 9 and 20 mutations of PIK3CA and their role in disease progression. A total of 118 tumor samples from confirmed breast cancer patients were collected from the histopathology laboratory at King Fahd Hospital of the University (Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia). Sanger sequencing was performed on extracted DNA to identify the mutations on exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA. The results were further validated by competitive allele-specific TaqMan polymerase chain reaction. Three mutations, namely E542K and E545K within exon 9, and H1047R within exon 20, were observed in 25 patients (21.2%). Among these, 18 patients carried the H1047R mutation of the kinase domain, while the remaining 7 patients carried mutations in the helical domain. PIK3CA mutations were associated with the estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive (ER+/PR+) group of tumors in contrast to the ER-/PR- group (P=0.021). Furthermore, it was observed that the PIK3CA mutation was associated with a poor disease prognosis. Taken together, the current study emphasized the potential of PIK3CA mutations as an important biomarker for breast cancer classification and the possible use of PIK3CA inhibitor as targeted therapy for breast cancer.|Cancer
ID:31406244|Title:FDA-approved drug screen identifies proteasome as a synthetic lethal target in MYC-driven neuroblastoma.Abstract:MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma predicts poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. Yet pharmacological strategies of direct MYC inhibition remain unsuccessful due to its "undruggable" protein structure. We herein developed a synthetic lethal screen against MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas using clinically approved therapeutic reagents. We performed a high-throughput screen, from a library of 938 FDA-approved drugs, for candidates that elicit synthetic lethal effects in MYC-driven neuroblastoma cells. The proteasome inhibitors, which are FDA approved for the first-line treatment of multiple myeloma, emerge as top hits to elicit MYC-mediated synthetic lethality. Proteasome inhibition activates the PERK-eIF2alpha-ATF4 axis in MYC-transformed cells and induces BAX-mediated apoptosis through ATF4-dependent NOXA and TRIB3 induction. A combination screen reveals the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat (SAHA) concertedly induce dramatic cell death in part through synergistic activation of BAX. This combination causes marked tumor suppression in vivo, supporting dual proteasome/HDAC inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for MYC-driven cancers. This FDA-approved drug screen with in vivo validation thus provides a rationale for clinical evaluation of bortezomib, alone or in combination with vorinostat, in MYC-driven neuroblastoma patients.|Cancer
ID:31407494|Title:Risk stratification for lung adenocarcinoma on EGFR and TP53 mutation status, chemotherapy, and PD-L1 immunotherapy.Abstract:The overall survival rates for lung cancer remain unsatisfactorily low, even for patients with biomarkers for which target therapies or immunotherapies are recommended. Better identification of at-risk patients is needed to achieve more effective personalized treatment. Here, we derived a risk-stratifying gene signature consisting of five genes that had the greatest differential expression by stage from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) transcriptomes. The new gene signature enabled survival prognosis for multiple LUAD datasets from different platforms of transcriptomics and risk stratification for patients with and without a mutation in TP53 or EGFR, with high and low levels of PD-L1, and with and without adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Using these evaluations, it was also shown to be more robust compared to several other gene signatures. Functional analysis of the five genes and their protein-protein interaction partners indicated that they are functionally enriched in cell cycle, endocytosis, and EGFR regulation, which are biological processes associated with lung cancer and drug resistance. Extensive discussions on related experimental studies suggest that the five genes are novel and sensible targets for developing new drugs and/or tackling drug resistance problems for LUAD.|Cancer
ID:31409085|Title:An Update on Inherited Colon Cancer and Gastrointestinal Polyposis.Abstract:BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 5-10% of colorectal cancers arise due to a known genetic syndrome. Individuals with these cancer syndromes are also at risk of extracolonic cancers. Polyposis and nonpolyposis hereditary syndromes are generally recognized. Inclusion of next-generation sequencing technology, especially multiple-gene panel testing, in routine laboratory practice has made identifying the causes of these diseases significantly easier. PURPOSE: To summarize current knowledge of the causes, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, and recommendations for presymptomatic screening of individuals at risk of hereditary gastrointestinal polyposis and colorectal cancer syndromes. We dicuss currently defined syndromes detected by multiple-gene panel next-generation sequencing; these include constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (biallelic MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 gene mutations), gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach (APC gene), NTHL1-associated polyposis, polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis (POLD1, POLE genes), juvenile polyposis (SMAD4, BMPR1A genes), and serrated polyposis syndromes. Another aim is to summarize recent knowledge about well-known syndromes, including hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (Lynch syndrome), familial adenomatous polyposis, MUTYH-associated polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers and Cowden/PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes. CONCLUSION: Awareness of hereditary polyposis/colon cancer syndromes enables early diagnosis and prevention of cancer in affected individuals and their relatives. Genetic counseling, presymptomatic testing of at-risk individuals, and efficient screening may be beneficial for affected families.

ID:31412428|Title:Molecular biomarkers predicting early development of endometrial carcinoma: A pilot study.Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Endometrial carcinoma represents the most common gynaecological cancer and the sixth most frequent cancer among women worldwide. The 5-year survival of patients with stage I endometrial carcinoma is 75%-88% versus 50% for stage III or 15% for stage IV disease. Therefore, early detection could improve survival rates. Specifically, in the most prevalent, type 1 endometrial cancer develops from hyperplastic endometrium. The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of cancer gene mutations from endometrial biopsies towards predicting synchronous or metachronous development of malignant lesions. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether endometrial biopsies could already carry mutations in cancer genes useful for predicting or anticipating subsequent cancer development. METHODS: Patients with a previous endometrial biopsy negative for cancer, followed by a subsequent biopsy positive for cancer, were included in the study. A fifty cancer genes targeted next-generation sequencing panel were used to investigate mutations in matched non-cancerous and malignant samples. RESULTS: All biopsies from cancer tissues harboured mutations in one or more of the following genes: APC, CTNNB1, FBXW7, HNF1A, KRAS, MTOR, NRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, RB1 and TP53. Additionally, 50% of the biopsies from matched non-cancerous tissues exhibited mutations in PTEN, KRAS or PIK3CA genes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that detecting pathogenic mutations in oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes in an otherwise benign condition is associated with a risk of developing a malignant disease. Given the identification of mutations several months or years before the appearance of a malignancy, our finding suggests that a closer monitoring of patients who present such molecular alterations in non-cancerous uterine mass is warranted.|Cancer
ID:31412611|Title:Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) for Detecting Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) Rearrangement in Lung Cancer: Clinically Relevant Technical Aspects.Abstract:In 2011, the Vysis Break Apart ALK fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a companion diagnostic for detecting ALK rearrangement in lung cancer patients who may benefit from treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. This assay is the current "gold standard". According to updated ALK testing guidelines from the College of American Pathologists, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and the Association for Molecular Pathology published in 2018, ALK immunohistochemistry is formally an alternative to ALK FISH, and simultaneous detection of multiple hot spots, including, at least, ALK, ROS1, RET, MET, ERBB2, BRAF and KRAS genes is also recommended while performing next generation sequencing (NGS)-based testing. Therefore, ALK status in a specimen can be tested by different methods and platforms, even in the same institution or laboratory. In this review, we discuss several clinically relevant technical aspects of ALK FISH, including pros and cons of the unique two-step (50- to 100-cell) analysis approach employed in the Vysis Break Apart ALK FISH assay, including: the preset cutoff value of >=15% for a positive result; technical aspects and biology of discordant results obtained by different methods; and incidental findings, such as ALK copy number gain or amplification and co-existent driver mutations. These issues have practical implications for ALK testing in the clinical laboratory following the updated guidelines.|Cancer
ID:31413087|Title:IL6R-STAT3-ADAR1 (P150) interplay promotes oncogenicity in multiple myeloma with 1q21 amplification.Abstract:1q21 amplification is an important prognostic marker in multiple myeloma. In this study we identified that IL6R (the interleukin-6 membrane receptor) and ADAR1 (an RNA editing enzyme) are critical genes located within the minimally amplified 1q21 region. Loss of individual genes caused suppression to the oncogenic phenotypes, the magnitude of which was enhanced when both genes were concomitantly lost. Mechanistically, IL6R and ADAR1 collaborated to induce a hyper-activation of the oncogenic STAT3 pathway. High IL6R confers hypersensitivity to interleukin-6 binding, whereas, ADAR1 forms a constitutive feed-forward loop with STAT3 in a P150-isoform-predominant manner. In this respect, ADAR1-P150 acts as a direct transcriptional target for STAT3 and this STAT3-induced-P150 in turn directly interacts with and stabilizes the former protein, leading to a larger pool of proteins acting as oncogenic transcription factors for pro-survival genes. The importance of both IL6R and ADAR1-P150 in STAT3 signaling was further validated when concomitant knockdown of both genes impeded IL6-induced-STAT3 pathway activation. Clinical evaluation of various datasets of myeloma patients showed that low expression of either one or both genes was closely associated with a compromised STAT3 signature, confirming the involvement of IL6R and ADAR1 in the STAT3 pathway and underscoring their essential role in disease pathogenesis. In summary, our findings highlight the complexity of the STAT3 pathway in myeloma, in association with 1q21 amplification. This study therefore reveals a novel perspective on 1q21 abnormalities in myeloma and a potential therapeutic target for this cohort of high-risk patients.|Cancer
ID:31414211|Title:MYCN amplification drives an aggressive form of spinal ependymoma.Abstract:Spinal ependymal tumors form a histologically and molecularly heterogeneous group of tumors with generally good prognosis. However, their treatment can be challenging if infiltration of the spinal cord or dissemination throughout the central nervous system (CNS) occurs and, in these cases, clinical outcome remains poor. Here, we describe a new and relatively rare subgroup of spinal ependymal tumors identified using DNA methylation profiling that is distinct from other molecular subgroups of ependymoma. Copy number variation plots derived from DNA methylation arrays showed MYCN amplification as a characteristic genetic alteration in all cases of our cohort (n = 13), which was subsequently validated using fluorescence in situ hybridization. The histological diagnosis was anaplastic ependymoma (WHO Grade III) in ten cases and classic ependymoma (WHO Grade II) in three cases. Histological re-evaluation in five primary tumors and seven relapses showed characteristic histological features of ependymoma, namely pseudorosettes, GFAP- and EMA positivity. Electron microscopy revealed cilia, complex intercellular junctions and intermediate filaments in a representative sample. Taking these findings into account, we suggest to designate this molecular subgroup spinal ependymoma with MYCN amplification, SP-EPN-MYCN. SP-EPN-MYCN tumors showed distinct growth patterns with intradural, extramedullary localization mostly within the thoracic and cervical spine, diffuse leptomeningeal spread throughout the whole CNS and infiltrative invasion of the spinal cord. Dissemination was observed in 100% of cases. Despite high-intensity treatment, SP-EPN-MYCN showed significantly worse median progression free survival (PFS) (17 months) and median overall survival (OS) (87 months) than all other previously described molecular spinal ependymoma subgroups. OS and PFS were similar to supratentorial ependymoma with RELA-fusion (ST-EPN-RELA) and posterior fossa ependymoma A (PF-EPN-A), further highlighting the aggressiveness of this distinct new subgroup. We, therefore, propose to establish SP-EPN-MYCN as a new molecular subgroup in ependymoma and advocate for testing newly diagnosed spinal ependymal tumors for MYCN amplification.|Cancer
ID:31416192|Title:Understanding the Mechanisms of Resistance in EGFR-Positive NSCLC: From Tissue to Liquid Biopsy to Guide Treatment Strategy.Abstract:Liquid biopsy has emerged as an alternative source of nucleic acids for the management of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The use of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been recently introduced in clinical practice, resulting in the improvement of the identification of druggable EGFR mutations for the diagnosis and monitoring of response to targeted therapy. EGFR-dependent (T790M and C797S mutations) and independent (Mesenchymal Epithelial Transition [MET] gene amplification, Kirsten Rat Sarcoma [KRAS], Phosphatidyl-Inositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic subunit Alpha isoform [PI3KCA], and RAF murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 [BRAF] gene mutations) mechanisms of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been evaluated in plasma samples from NSCLC patients using highly sensitive methods (i.e., digital droplet PCR, Next Generation Sequencing), allowing for the switch to other therapies. Therefore, liquid biopsy is a non-invasive method able to detect the molecular dynamic changes that occur under the pressure of treatment, and to capture tumor heterogeneity more efficiently than is allowed by tissue biopsy. This review addresses how liquid biopsy may be used to guide the choice of treatment strategy in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.|Cancer
ID:31421692|Title:Current state of biomarkers for the diagnosis and assessment of treatment efficacy of prostate cancer.Abstract:In recent years, with the westernization of lifestyle, reduced physical activity and increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, the incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) has risen significantly in developing countries. Currently, PSA is the only PCa biomarker applied clinically, but it does not perform well in the early diagnosis and distinguishing between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. With the advances in deep sequencing technology, a series of new PCa biomarkers have been recently proposed to improve the diagnostic value of PSA, such as prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), TMPRSS2-ETS fusion gene, microRNA, and other regulatory non-coding RNAs. In addition, the prostate health index (PHI) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use in the detection of PCa. The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been confirmed to be specifically expressed on the surface of PCa cells. In this review, we provide an updated summary of the value and features of these novel biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.|Cancer
ID:31426797|Title:Unusual synchronous double primary treatment-naive lung adenocarcinoma harboring T790M and L858R mutations in early-stage lung cancer.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Concurrent mutations of synchronous multiple primary non-small cell lung cancer (SMPNSCLC) is rare, and only a few cases have been reported. Herein, we present a case of early-stage SMPNSCLC with T790M and L858R mutations. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old male patient presented to the Thoracic Surgery Department due to a tumor in the right lower lung. The tumor was detected more than 5 years previously during a health examination; however, the patient ignored the problem because the clinician at that time stated that the lesion was highly likely to be benign. Chest computed topography (CT) was ordered and the images showed a well-defined tumor in the right lower lung and a faint nodular lesion over the left lower lung field. A CT-guided biopsy results showed the presence of atypical cells and positive staining of TTF-1 and CK7. Surgical intervention was performed. The right- and left-sided tumors disclosed micropapillary predominant adenocarcinoma and acinar-predominant adenocarcinoma, respectively. Both tumors were positive for TTF-1 but negative for ALK and p40. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the right-sided tumor had an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation presenting as point mutation T790M in exon 20, while the left-sided tumor had a point mutation L858R in exon 21 of EGFR. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient's case suggests that tumors resembling a benign pattern with central calcification may be misdiagnosed. Thus, early screening for lung cancer is important, and intensive efforts to make a diagnosis through surgical resection or biopsies to allow for tailored optimal treatment may be preferential for the best patient outcomes.|Cancer
ID:31426864|Title:18F-FDG-PET-based Radiomics signature predicts MGMT promoter methylation status in primary diffuse glioma.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter has emerged as a favorable independent prognostic and predictive biomarker in glioma. This study aimed to build a radiomics signature based on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for noninvasive measurement of the MGMT promoter methylation status in glioma. METHODS: One hundred and seven pathology-confirmed primary diffuse glioma patients were retrospectively included and randomly assigned to the primary (n = 71) or validation cohort (n = 36). The MGMT promoter methylation status was measured by pyrosequencing. A total of 1561 radiomics features were extracted from the three-dimensional region of interest (ROI) on the standard uptake value (SUV) maps that were generated from the original 18F-FDG PET data. A radiomics signature, a clinical signature and a fusion signature that combined the clinical and radiomics features together were generated. The performance of the three signatures was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the patient prognosis was stratified based on the MGMT promoter methylation status and the signature with the best performance. RESULTS: Five radiomics features were selected to construct the radiomics signature, and displayed the best performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) reaching 0.94 and 0.86 in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively, which outweigh the performances of clinical signature and fusion signature. With a median follow-up time of 32.4 months, the radiomics signature stratified the glioma patients into two risk groups with significantly different prognoses (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: 18F-FDG-PET-based radiomics is a promising approach for preoperatively evaluating the MGMT promoter methylation status in glioma and predicting the prognosis of glioma patients noninvasively.|Cancer
ID:31427547|Title:Androgen receptor expression in triple negative breast carcinoma and its association with the clinicopathological parameters.Abstract:INTRODUCTION: Androgen receptor (AR) is the most frequently expressed biomarker in all subtypes of breast carcinoma. Triple negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) is breast carcinoma that lacks oestrogen and progesterone receptors immunoexpression as well as absence of HER2/neu gene amplification. This makes targeted therapy not feasible in this cancer and hence has poorer prognosis. Detecting AR expression could be another milestone in the management of TNBC, as AR is a prognostic, predictive marker and potential index for targeted treatment. This study aimed to assess expression of AR in TNBC by immunohistochemistry and its association with clinicopathological parameters. METHODS: We analysed the expression of AR in 97 TNBC cases from Penang General Hospital for a period of 3 years (2014 to 2017). Androgen receptor immunoreactivity was considered positive if >= 1% of tumour cells nuclei were stained irrespective of staining intensity. RESULTS: The prevalence of AR expression in TNBC was 31% (30/97), with the proportion of AR-positive tumour cells ranged from 1% to 90%. These include 23 invasive carcinomas, no special type (NST) and 7 other invasive carcinoma subtypes (papillary, lobular, clear cell and medullary carcinomas). Sixty-seven cases (69%) that showed AR immunonegativity were invasive carcinomas, NST (n=60), clear cell carcinoma (n=1) and metaplastic carcinoma (n=6). Androgen receptor immunoexpression was inversely correlated with tumour grade (p=0.016), but not the tumour stage, tumour size and nodal status. CONCLUSION: AR is expressed in about one-third of TNBC and loss of AR immunoexpression does not predict adverse clinical outcomes. Larger cohorts for better characterisation of the role of AR immunoexpression in TNBC are warranted.|Cancer
ID:31428516|Title:High-throughput assessment of the antibody profile in ovarian cancer ascitic fluids.Abstract:The identification of effective biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatments remains a challenge in ovarian cancer (OC) research. Here, we present an unbiased high-throughput approach to profile ascitic fluid autoantibodies in order to obtain a tumor-specific antigen signature in OC. We first reported the reactivity of immunoglobulins (Igs) purified from OC patient ascites towards two different OC cell lines. Using a discovery set of Igs, we selected tumor-specific antigens from a phage display cDNA library. After biopanning, 700 proteins were expressed as fusion protein and used in protein array to enable large-scale immunoscreening with independent sets of cancer and noncancerous control. Finally, the selected antigens were validated by ELISA. The initial screening identified eight antigenic clones: CREB3, MRPL46, EXOSC10, BCOR, HMGN2, HIP1R, OLFM4, and KIAA1755. These antigens were all validated by ELISA in a study involving ascitic Igs from 153 patients (69 with OC, 34 with other cancers and 50 without cancer), with CREB3 showing the highest sensitivity (86.95%) and specificity (98%). Notably, we were able to identify an association between the tumor-associated (TA) antibody response and the response to a first-line tumor treatment (platinum-based chemotherapy). A stronger association was found by combining three antigens (BCOR, CREB3, and MRLP46) as a single antibody signature. Measurement of an ascitic fluid antibody response to multiple TA antigens may aid in the identification of new prognostic signatures in OC patients and shift attention to new potentially relevant targets.|Cancer
ID:31428572|Title:Mutation Spectrum of Cancer-Associated Genes in Patients With Early Onset of Colorectal Cancer.Abstract:Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence is rising worldwide, as well as in the Republic of Kazakhstan, while its occurrence is also increasing in the younger population. Hereditary forms associated with the development of colon and rectal cancer and early-onset CRC have never been studied in the population of Kazakhstan. The aim of this research was to investigate the spectrum of CRC-related gene mutations to determine which mutations cause early onset of CRC in the Kazakhstan population. Methods: The study included 125 unrelated patients from Kazakhstan (range 17-50 years in age) with early onset CRC. Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral blood of the patients. Next-generation sequencing was performed using the TruSightCancer Kit on the MiSeq platform. The Studio Variant was used to annotate and interpret genetic variants. Results: Bioinformatics analysis of Next-generation sequencing data revealed 11,152 variants from 85 genes, of them, 3,790 missense, 6,254 synonymous variants, 44 3'UTR variants, 10 frameshift variants, five stop-gain variants, four in-frame deletions, two splice donors, one splice acceptor variant, and 1,042 intron or non-coding variants. APC, BRCA2/1, ALK, BRIP1, EGFR, FANCA, FANCD2, FANCI, HNF1A, MEN1, NSD1, PMS2, RECQL4, RET, SLX4, WRN, and XPC genes mutated most often. According to the ACMG guidelines and LOVD/ClinVar databases, 24 variants were pathogenic (10 frameshifts, five missenses, five stop-gain, one in-frame deletion, and three splice-site mutations), and 289 were VUS with population frequency <1%, 131 of them were attributed as deleterious. In the study, 50% of all pathogenic mutations found in Kazakhstani patients with early CRC onset were identified in the subgroups with a family history of CRC and primary multiple tumors. In APC, pathogenic mutations were most often (21%). Conclusion: Pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations were found in 20 (16%) out of 125 patients. Eight novel pathogenic mutations detected in FANCI, APC, BMPR1, ATM, and DICER1 genes have not been reported in previous literature. Given the high frequency and wide spectrum of mutations, NGS analysis must be carried out in families with a history of CRC/CRC-related cancers with the purpose to identify cause-effective mutations, clarify the clinical diagnosis, and prevent the development of the disease in other family members.|Cancer
ID:31433233|Title:[Molecular cytogenetic analyses of patients with plasma cell myeloma in Tolna and Baranya counties in Hungary].Abstract:Introduction: Plasma cell myeloma is a hematological malignancy with heterogeneous genomic landscape and diverse clinical course. Recurrent chromosomal and subchromosomal aberrations commonly occur in this entity and are associated with the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. The identification of these alterations aids genetic characterization, classification and prognostication of patients. Aim: Molecular cytogenetic investigations of plasma cell myeloma patients treated at the University of Pecs Clinical Center and Janos Balassa County Hospital of Tolna County, Szekszard, between 2005 and 2018 were evaluated in our study. Method: 231 patients were screened for genetic aberrations using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, losses of 1p and 17p chromosome arms, gains of 1q chromosome arm and unbalanced aberrations of chromosome 13 were investigated. Losses and gains of 1p, 1q, 5q, 12p, 13q, 16q and 17p chromosome arms were analyzed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification in 42 patients. During the investigated period, 116 bone marrow karyotyping was also performed. Results: In total, 233 genetic aberrations were identified using our targeted approaches; the frequency of specific aberrations correlated with data of the recent literature. Concordance of results gained by fluorescence in situ hybridization and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was 96.2% by analyzing the same chromosome arms. The latter technique revealed 21 additional genetic aberrations in 16/42 patient samples (38%) as compared to fluorescence in situ hybridization. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the combined application of the two molecular cytogenetic methods may facilitate a more detailed characterization of genetic aberrations of plasma cell myeloma patients in Hungary.

ID:31433323|Title:Melanocytic Skin Neoplasms: What Lesson From Genomic Aberrations?Abstract:Studies on the genomic aberrations in melanocytic neoplasms have shown a complex genomic landscape. In nevi and melanomas, a MAP-kinase pathway activation was generally found, produced by different chromosomal aberrations, including BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, GNAQ, GNA11, BAP1, CTNNB1, MAP2K1, PRKAR1A, and NF1 mutations, and ALK, ROS1, NTRK1, RET, MET, BRAF, NTRK3, and PRKCA fusions. Melanomas also showed a variable number of additional mutations ablating tumor-suppression mechanisms and activating other oncogenic pathways, including CDKN2A loss, PTEN loss, as well as TP53 and TERT-promoter mutations. Moreover, borderline melanocytic tumors displayed the same chromosomal aberrations, but more mutations than nevi and fewer than melanomas. In this context, the notion that melanocytic neoplasms can be classified as benign/malignant is hardly supportable, because all neoplasms harbor a certain number of mutations and the progression risk, that is, the malignant potential, is related and proportional to the burden of pathogenic mutations. Moreover, from the genomic analysis, in parallel to the current diagnostic categories of "nevi," "melanomas," and "melanocytomas," some aggregations or classes of tumors based on the characteristic types of driver mutations/fusions emerge as possible and more rationale, including Spitzoid neoplasms, blue neoplasms, BAP1-inactivated melanocytic neoplasms, deep penetrating melanocytic neoplasms, pigment-synthesizing melanocytic neoplasms, and "common" melanocytic neoplasms. Each of these classes, showing the same driver mutations/fusions, demonstrates to have the same pathogenesis and may be genetically considered as a single tumor, although with a variable amount of progression risk. Histologic features, being an expression of the mutational state, could be used to obtain an approximate risk assessment in each single tumor.|Cancer
ID:31440211|Title:Gonadal Failure Is Common in Long-Term Survivors of Childhood High-Risk Neuroblastoma Treated With High-Dose Chemotherapy and Autologous Stem Cell Rescue.Abstract:Background: Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor in children. Intensive therapy including autologous stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) has improved the poor prognosis of high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NBL) but may impair gonadal function. Objectives: To investigate the gonadal function and fertility in long-term survivors of childhood HR-NBL. Design: A cohort including all Finnish (n = 20; 11 females) long-term (>10 years) survivors of HR-NBL and an age- and sex-matched control group (n = 20) was examined at a median age of 22 (16-30) years. Oncologic treatments, pubertal timing, hormonal therapies and the number of off-spring were recorded, and pituitary and gonadal hormones were measured. Results: Altogether 16/20 of the long-term survivors of HR-NBL entered puberty spontaneously; puberty was hormonally induced in four survivors (three females). Among the 8/11 female survivors with spontaneous puberty, seven had spontaneous menarche, but 5/8 developed ovarian failure soon after puberty. Nine females currently needed estrogen substitution. AMH, a marker of ovarian reserve, was lower in the female survivors than controls (median 0.02 vs. 1.7 mug/l, p < 0.001). As a group, male survivors had smaller testicular size (8.5 vs. 39 ml, p < 0.001) and lower inhibin B (<10 vs. 170 ng/l, p < 0.001) compared with control males, with altogether 6/9 survivor males fulfilling the criteria of gonadal failure (absent puberty, small testicle size or increased FSH with need of testosterone substitution). Gonadal failure was more common in female and male survivors treated with total-body irradiation. Three survivors (one male) had offspring, all treated without total-body irradiation and moderate dose of alkylating chemotherapy. Growth velocity was compromised in all survivors after HR-NBL diagnosis, with absent pubertal growth spurt in 7/17 survivors with complete growth data. Conclusion: Gonadal failure is common in long-term survivors of HR-NBL treated with HSCT. Fertility may be preserved in some survivors treated without total-body irradiation.|Cancer
ID:31441848|Title:Management of tumor rupture and abdominal compartment syndrome in an infant with bilateral high risk stage 4 neuroblastoma: A case report.Abstract:RATIONALE: Tumor rupture and bleeding at initial presentation of infants with neuroblastoma (NBL) is a rare, but life threatening condition and challenge in pediatric oncology. Here, we report successful multidisciplinary management of an abdominal compartment syndrome as a result of tumor rupture and bleeding in an infant with bilateral high risk stage 4 NBL. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was admitted to a cooperating hospital with vomiting, failure to thrive and a large mass in the abdomen and was then referred to our center. DIAGNOSES: Stage 4 NBL with MYC-N amplification and 1p36 deletion was diagnosed in an 11 months old girl. Due to rapid and massive tumor growth she developed abdominal compression with renal failure, severe bleeding, and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). INTERVENTIONS: Surgical decompression by enterostomy, local, and systemic bleeding control with platelets and coagulation factors, antiinfective and TLS therapy were effective in stabilizing the patient's condition. This allowed initiation of the multimodal antineoplastic treatment according to protocol NB 2004. OUTCOMES: Mechanical ventilation was stopped after 11 days, the abdominal wall was closed 3 months after the start of therapy, and treatment according to the protocol be started and successfully completed. LESSONS: Only the immediate, coordinated multidisciplinary intervention managed to overcome the life-threatening abdominal compartment syndrome and its associated problems, eventually enabling successful curative treatment.|Cancer
ID:31443309|Title:Malignant Pleural Effusion and Its Current Management: A Review.Abstract:Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is an exudative effusion with malignant cells. MPE is a common symptom and accompanying manifestation of metastatic disease. It affects up to 15% of all patients with cancer and is the most common in lung, breast cancer, lymphoma, gynecological malignancies and malignant mesothelioma. In the last year, many studies were performed focusing on the pathophysiological mechanisms of MPE. With the advancement in molecular techniques, the importance of tumor-host cell interactions is becoming more apparent. Additionally, the process of pathogenesis is greatly affected by activating mutations of EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, MET, EML4/ALK and RET, which correlate with an increased incidence of MPE. Considering all these changes, the authors aim to present a literature review of the newest findings, review of the guidelines and pathophysiological novelties in this field. Review of the just recently, after seven years published, practice guidelines, as well as analysis of more than 70 articles from the Pubmed, Medline databases that were almost exclusively published in indexed journals in the last few years, have relevance and contribute to the better understanding of the presented topic. MPE still presents a severe medical condition in patients with advanced malignancy. Recent findings in the field of pathophysiological mechanisms of MPE emphasize the role of molecular factors and mutations in the dynamics of the disease and its prognosis. Treatment guidelines offer a patient-centric approach with the use of new scoring systems, an out of hospital approach and ultrasound. The current guidelines address multiple areas of interest bring novelties in the form of validated prediction tools and can, based on evidence, improve patient outcomes. However, the role of biomarkers in a clinical setting, possible new treatment modalities and certain specific situations still present a challenge for new research.|Cancer
ID:31448040|Title:[Multiple hemorragic brain lesions revealing metastatic melanoma].Abstract:Nearly 75% of patients with metastatic melanoma develop brain metastases. We here report the case of an 83 year-old woman hospitalized for secondarily generalized clonic seizures of the left leg with partial convulsive seizures in the Resuscitation Department. Melanoma resection of the left ankle had been performed 6 months before her admission. Neurological examination showed left ataxic crural monoparesis. Electro-encephalogram showed central and right frontal focus with left-sided dissemination. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed multiple supratentorial and subtentorial encephalic lesions with varying size and shape, with T1 hypersignal (A and A'), haemorrhage on T2*-weighted sequences (B and B'), gadolinium-enhancing T1 with perilesional edema on Flair sequences. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed multiple lymph node and bone metastases. Lymph node biopsy was negative for VE1 antibody with no BRAFV600E mutation by immunohistochemistry. An increase in the number of metastatic lesions was observed during control brain CT scan despite 10 brain radiotherapy sessions motivating palliative care. Epileptic seizures were controlled with levetiracetam. In patient with multiple hemorrhagic and spontaneous brain lesions, it is essential to obtain informations on patient's history of melanoma and to perform a thorough dermatologic examination in order to investigate its cause and to establish adequate therapeutic treatment.|Cancer
ID:31452453|Title:How Many Papillae in Conventional Papillary Carcinoma? A Clinical Evidence-Based Pathology Study of 235 Unifocal Encapsulated Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas, with Emphasis on the Diagnosis of Noninvasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear Features.Abstract:Background: The percentage of papillae is a crucial criterion in differentiating noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) from papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) and in subclassifying PTC into classic and follicular variant. Since the description of NIFTP, three studies have shown that the presence of any papillae may be associated with nodal metastasis, which led to modification of the NIFTP criterion from <1% papillae to no true papillae allowed. We aim at providing clinical evidence-based data on the impact that papillary growth has on nodal spread and tumor genotype in tumors previously diagnosed as encapsulated unifocal PTC. Methods: A meticulous histopathologic examination was performed on 235 cases previously diagnosed as unifocal encapsulated PTC (U-EPTC). One hundred of these cases were subjected to BRAFV600E and NRASQ61R immunohistochemistry. Results: In our cohort, 27 patients (12%) had lymph node metastasis (N1) at the time of initial resection. Overall, 89% of the tumors in the N1 group contained >=50% papillae, compared with 13% in the N0/Nx group. Nodal metastases were only present in tumors with >=1% papillae. In noninvasive U-EPTC (n = 161), N1 disease was seen only in tumors with >=10% papillae. A higher percentage of papillae within the tumor also correlated with an increased frequency of BRAFV600E and decreased rate of NRASQ61R. None of the 26 NRAS-positive cases had nodal disease, including the invasive tumors. Among 216 patients with follow-up (median: 5.2 years), 3 patients (1.5%) had distant metastases, all detected at the initial presentation. All three tumors displayed 100% follicular growth, and capsular or vascular invasion. There was no locoregional recurrence in the entire cohort. Conclusion: In U-EPTC, there is a strong correlation between high percentage of papillary growth, presence of nodal metastasis, and BRAF+/RAS- genotype regardless of invasive status. Nodal metastases were not seen in tumors with <1% papillae irrespective of invasive status. These findings indicate that the initial criterion of <1% papillae is still valid for the diagnosis of NIFTP. Reinstituting this criterion will spare a carcinoma diagnosis and unnecessary therapy with its side effects on patients who have negligible clinical risk.|Cancer
ID:31452761|Title:miR-27a-3p regulates proliferation and apoptosis of colon cancer cells by potentially targeting BTG1.Abstract:microRNA (miR/miRNA)-27a-3p has been reported to be abnormally expressed in various types of cancer, including colorectal cancer (CRC). B-cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1) has also been implicated with CRC. However, the association between miR-27a-3p and BTG1 in CRC, to the best of our knowledge, has not been investigated. In order to assess whether miR-27a-3p is associated with CRC, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed on 20 paired CRC and paracancerous tissues for miRNA analysis. For the screening and validation of miR-27a-3p expression in colon cancer, several colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116, HCT8, SW480, HT29, LOVO and Caco2) and the normal colorectal epithelial cell line NCM460 were examined. The highest expression levels of miR-27a-3p were detected in the HCT-116, which was selected for further experimentation. The HCT-116 cells were divided into control, miR-27a-3p mimic and inhibitor groups, and cell proliferation was tested using an MTT assay. Additionally, miR-27a-3p inhibitor/mimic or BTG1 plasmid were transfected into the HCT-116 cells, and flow cytometry was performed to analyze cell cycle distributions. TUNEL analysis was performed to detect apoptosis. Protein levels of factors in the downstream signaling pathway mediated by miR-27a-3p [ERK/mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK)] were detected. miR-27a-3p was revealed to be overexpressed in human CRC tissues and colon cancer cell lines. Knockdown of miR-27a-3p suppressed proliferation of HCT-116 cells and apoptosis was increased. It further markedly upregulated expression levels of BTG1 and inhibited activation of proteins of the ERK/MEK signaling pathway. In addition, overexpression of BTG1 in HCT-116 cells triggered G1/S phase cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis via the ERK/MEK signaling pathway. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the effects of miR-27a-3p on colon cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis were similar to those of the tumor suppressor gene BTG1. The miR-27a-3p/BTG1 axis may have potential implications for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in CRC.|Cancer
ID:31455365|Title:ALK rearrangement: a high-frequency alteration in ovarian metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Ovarian metastatic tumors from lung adenocarcinoma are rare, and a serial study of these tumors is lacking to date. Additionally, a better understanding of the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of metastatic tumors is needed. METHODS: Seven cases of ovarian metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma from 2013 to 2017 at our institute were investigated. The results were combined with those found in literature review. A total of 16 cases were analyzed in the present study. We examined clinicopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics, further detected ALK rearrangement by FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), and assessed EGFR and KRAS mutations using Sanger sequencing or the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 44.6 years (range, 33-56 years). Eleven of sixteen patients developed ovarian tumors within a mean time of 18.5 months (range, 5-48 months) from the initial diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma; 5 patients had lung tumors and ovarian masses simultaneously. Five tumors (5/16, 31%) occurred in the bilateral ovaries, and the others were unilateral ovarian tumors (11/16, 69%). All seven cases from our institute were positive for TTF-1 and Napsin A but negative for PAX8. In four cases, ALK (D5F3) was diffusely and strongly expressed, with ALK rearrangements (4/7, 57%). Overall, ALK rearrangement was found by FISH or immunohistochemistry in 11/16 (69%) cases. In two cases, EGFR mutations in exons 19 and 21, respectively, were found. One patient did not detected EGFR or ALK mutation in the metastatic tumor, but the primary lung adenocarcinoma did harbor an EGFR mutation. Two cases had no alterations in three genes above. Although the mean survival time of the patients with ALK rearrangement was longer than those without (mean survival time 25 m vs. 20 m), no statistical significance of the difference was found. CONCLUSIONS: As the largest case series of ovarian metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma, our findings indicate that ALK rearrangement is the most common molecular alteration. Although patients with ALK rearrangement appear to have a better prognosis than do those without ALK rearrangement, more cases with longer follow-up and multivariant analysis are needed to clarify this point.|Cancer
ID:31461190|Title:Adenomatous Polyposis Coli as a Major Regulator of Human Embryonic Stem Cells Self-Renewal.Abstract:Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) provide an essential tool to investigate early human development, study disease pathogenesis, and examine therapeutic interventions. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, implicated in the majority of sporadic colorectal cancers and in the autosomal dominant inherited syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Studies into the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in hESCs arrived at conflicting results, due at least in part to variations in culture conditions and the use of external inhibitors and agonists. Here, we directly targeted APC in hESCs carrying a germline APC mutation, derived from affected blastocysts following preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for FAP, in order to answer open questions regarding the role of APC in regulating pluripotency and differentiation potential of hESCs. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9), we generated second hit APC mutations in FAP-hESCs. Despite high CRISPR/Cas9 targeting efficiency and the successful isolation of many clones, none of the isolated clones carried a loss of function mutation in the wild-type (WT) APC allele. Using a fluorescent beta-catenin reporter and analysis of mutated-allele frequencies in the APC locus, we show that APC double mutant hESCs robustly activate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling that results in rapid differentiation to endodermal and mesodermal lineages. Here, we provide direct evidence for a strict requirement for constant beta-catenin degradation through the APC destruction complex in order to maintain pluripotency, highlighting a fundamental role for APC in self-renewal of hESCs.

ID:31462891|Title:Haploinsufficiency of NR3C1 drives glucocorticoid resistance in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells by down-regulating the mitochondrial apoptosis axis, and is sensitive to Bcl-2 blockage.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Relapse represents the leading cause of death in both child and adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Development of chemo-resistance is ultimately responsible for treatment failure and relapse, therefore understanding the molecular basis underlying resistance is imperative for developing innovative treatment strategies. Glucocorticoids (GCs) such dexamethasone and prednisolone are the backbone of combination chemotherapy regimens for treating all lymphoid tumors. However, the biological mechanisms of primary GC resistance in ALL is not completely understood. We previously performed a longitudinal whole-exome sequencing analysis on diagnosis/relapse pairs from adult patients with ALL. Our data revealed that relapse-specific truncation mutations in the NR3C1 gene, encoding the GC receptor, are frequently detected. METHODS: In the current study, we used discovery-based strategies including RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and CRISPR/Cas9, followed by confirmatory testing, in human ALL cell lines, bone marrow blast samples from ALL patients and xenograft models, to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for resistance. RESULTS: Our results revealed a positive correlation between endogenous expression of NR3C1 in ALL cells and sensitivity to GCs and clinical outcomes. We further confirmed that ectopic expression of NR3C1 in ALL cells could reverse GC resistance, while deletion of NR3C1 confers resistance to GCs in ALL cell lines and xenograft models. RNA-seq analysis revealed a remarkable abundance of gene signatures involved in pathways in cancer, DNA replication, mismatch repair, P53 signalling, cell cycle, and apoptosis regulated by NR3C1. Significantly increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes including BCL2L11/Bim, BMF, BAD, BAX and BOK, and decreased transcription of anti-apoptotic genes including BCL2, BCL2L1 and BAG2 were observed in GC-resistant ALL cells following ectopic expression of NR3C1. Finally, we explored that GC resistance in ALL cells with haploinsufficiency of NR3C1 can be treated with Bcl-2 blockage. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the status of NR3C1 gene mutations and basal expression levels of NR3C1 in ALL cells are associated with sensitivity to GCs and clinical treatment outcomes. Early intervention strategies by rational combination of Bcl-2 blockage may constitute a promising new treatment option to GC-resistant ALL and significantly improving the chances of treating poor prednisone responders.|Cancer
ID:31467295|Title:Association of caspase 8 polymorphisms -652 6N InsDel and Asp302His with progression-free survival and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in early breast cancer.Abstract:The caspase 8 variants CASP8 -652 6N InsDel and Asp302His have previously been identified to promote survival of T-lymphocytes and to indicate reduced breast cancer susceptibility. Besides some preliminary findings, prognostic relevance of these polymorphisms in patients with existing breast cancer has not been investigated. Considering an immunomodulatory role of these polymorphisms, we genotyped 785 early breast cancer patients and correlated caspase 8 variants with disease-free survival (DFS) and the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Early breast cancer specimens were collected as part of the multicenter prospective PiA study. Genotyping was performed by pyrosequencing, TILs status was assessed using hematoxylin & eosin staining. The CASP8 -652Del variant was significantly associated with improved DFS in an allele-dose dependent manner (p = 0.027). Homozygosity for the -652Del variant was an independent predictor for improved DFS (HR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.174-0.726; p = 0.005). In patients with the 302HisHis genotype, there was no event of recurrence during observation time. Combined analysis of diplotypes revealed an influence of both polymorphisms on DFS (p = 0.029). Interestingly, patients with the 302HisHis variant among the unstratified patient cohort (and among the luminal-like subtype, by trend) had tumors with lower lymphocyte infiltration (p = 0.025). We propose a prognostically favorable role of the -652Del and the 302His variant in primary breast cancer and suggest for the first time an association between polymorphisms in apoptosis-related genes and the immunophenotype in breast cancer. Our findings encourage further investigation of caspase 8 polymorphisms as biomarkers for prognostic and immunotherapeutic considerations.|Cancer
ID:31479144|Title:Medication Use to Reduce Risk of Breast Cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.Abstract:Importance: Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among women in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death. The median age at diagnosis is 62 years, and an estimated 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer at some point in their lifetime. African American women are more likely to die of breast cancer compared with women of other races. Objective: To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on medications for risk reduction of primary breast cancer. Evidence Review: The USPSTF reviewed evidence on the accuracy of risk assessment methods to identify women who could benefit from risk-reducing medications for breast cancer, as well as evidence on the effectiveness, adverse effects, and subgroup variations of these medications. The USPSTF reviewed evidence from randomized trials, observational studies, and diagnostic accuracy studies of risk stratification models in women without preexisting breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. Findings: The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk assessment tools can predict the number of cases of breast cancer expected to develop in a population. However, these risk assessment tools perform modestly at best in discriminating between individual women who will or will not develop breast cancer. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk-reducing medications (tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors) provide at least a moderate benefit in reducing risk for invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer. The USPSTF found that the benefits of taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors to reduce risk for breast cancer are no greater than small in women not at increased risk for the disease. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that tamoxifen and raloxifene and adequate evidence that aromatase inhibitors are associated with small to moderate harms. Overall, the USPSTF determined that the net benefit of taking medications to reduce risk of breast cancer is larger in women who have a greater risk for developing breast cancer. Conclusions and Recommendation: The USPSTF recommends that clinicians offer to prescribe risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors, to women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse medication effects. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against the routine use of risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors, in women who are not at increased risk for breast cancer. (D recommendation) This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women 35 years and older, including women with previous benign breast lesions on biopsy (such as atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ). This recommendation does not apply to women who have a current or previous diagnosis of breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ.|Cancer
ID:31479615|Title:The Origin and Pathogenesis of Endometriosis.Abstract:Recent molecular genetic findings on endometriosis and normal endometrium suggest a modified model in which circulating epithelial progenitor or stem cells intended to regenerate uterine endometrium after menstruation may become overreactive and trapped outside the uterus. These trapped epithelium-committed progenitor cells form nascent glands through clonal expansion and recruit polyclonal stromal cells, leading to the establishment of deep infiltrating endometriosis. Once formed, the ectopic tissue becomes subject to immune surveillance, resulting in chronic inflammation. The inflammatory response orchestrated by nuclear factor-kappaB signaling is exacerbated by aberrations in the estrogen receptor-beta and progesterone receptor pathways, which are also affected by local inflammation, forming a dysregulated inflammation-hormonal loop. Glandular epithelium within endometriotic tissue harbors cancer-associated mutations that are frequently detected in endometriosis-related ovarian cancers. In this review, we summarize recent advances that have illuminated the origin and pathogenesis of endometriosis and have provided new avenues for research that promise to improve the early diagnosis and management of endometriosis.|Cancer
ID:31481959|Title:A Novel BTK Gene Mutation in a Child With Atypical X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia and Recurrent Hemophagocytosis: A Case Report.Abstract:X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), caused by a mutation in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene, is rarely reported in patients with recurrent hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). This mutation leads to significantly reduced numbers of circulatory B cells and serum immunoglobulins in patients. Therefore, they exhibit repetitive bacterial infections since infancy, and immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy is the primary treatment. HLH is a life-threatening condition with manifestations of non-remitting fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, coagulopathy, lipid disorder, and multiple organ failure. It is caused by the immune dysregulation between cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and histiocytes. The treatment is based on HLH-2004 protocol including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, supportive therapy, and stem cell transplantation. However, as we know more about the classification and pathophysiology of HLH, the treatment is modified. T-cell-directed immunotherapy is effective in patients with primary HLH, and strong immunosuppression is contraindicated in patients with severe ongoing infections or some primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). Here, we report the case of a 7-year-old boy who presented with ecthyma gangrenosum and several episodes of pyogenic infections during childhood. At the age of 5 years, he exhibited cyclic HLH every 2-3 months. The remission of HLH episodes finally achieved after he received monthly Ig replacement therapy (400 mg/kg) at the 4th HLH. However, transient elevation of IgM was incidentally discovered after 6 cycles of monthly Ig replacement therapy. IgM-secreting multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and lymphoma were excluded. The IgM levels then declined and returned to the normal range within a year. The patient and his parents received whole-genome sequencing analysis. It revealed a novel hemizygous c.1632-1G>A mutation in the BTK gene and XLA was diagnosed. XLA exhibits a spectrum of clinical and immunological presentations in patients. The identification of the mutation in the BTK gene contribute to an accurate diagnosis. Ig replacement therapy is the primary treatment for HLH in patients with XLA.|Cancer
ID:31483231|Title:Overview of Current Immunotherapies Targeting Mutated KRAS Cancers.Abstract:The occurrence of somatic substitution mutations of the KRAS proto-oncogene is highly prevalent in certain cancer types, which often leads to constant activation of proliferative pathways and subsequent neoplastic transformation. It is often seen as a gateway mutation in carcinogenesis and has been commonly deemed as a predictive biomarker for poor prognosis and relapse when conventional chemotherapeutics are employed. Additionally, its mutational status also renders EGFR targeted therapies ineffective owing to its downstream location. Efforts to discover new approaches targeting this menacing culprit have been ongoing for years without much success, and with incidences of KRAS positive cancer patients being on the rise, researchers are now turning towards immunotherapies as the way forward. In this scoping review, recent immunotherapeutic developments and advances in both preclinical and clinical studies targeting K-ras directly or indirectly via its downstream signal transduction machinery will be discussed. Additionally, some of the challenges and limitations of various K-ras targeting immunotherapeutic approaches such as vaccines, adoptive T cell therapies, and checkpoint inhibitors against KRAS positive cancers will be deliberated.|Cancer
ID:31491579|Title:Recurrent Undifferentiated Carcinoma of the Sella in a Patient with Lynch Syndrome.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome (LS) is a cancer-predisposing condition resulting from germline mutations in deoxyribonucleic acid mismatch repair genes. Patients are at high risk for a multitude of tumors, but no reports of undifferentiated sellar carcinomas have previously been described. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old female with LS due to MSH2 and MSH6 mutations presented with panhypopituitarism and a sellar mass. She was initially diagnosed with pituitary apoplexy and treated nonoperatively. The mass self-resolved. The mass recurred 2 years later, and she underwent endoscopic endonasal biopsy demonstrating an undifferentiated carcinoma of the sella with MSH2 and MSH6 loss. The tumor was negative for pituitary markers and weakly positive for p63. The patient further developed lung and bone metastases and was treated with radiation and chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an undifferentiated carcinoma of the sella. Our patient harbored a diagnosis of LS and demonstrated local tumor recurrence and aggressive systemic progression. Patients with LS should undergo close follow-up and active surveillance to detect and treat these aggressive lesions in a timely manner.|Cancer
ID:31492087|Title:[Genetic testing of thyroid nodules using a gene panel developed on a new generation sequencing platform].Abstract:Introduction: Twenty-five percent of fine-needle aspiration biopsy samples of thyroid nodules produce indeterminate cytological results. Genetic testing of nodules can contribute to accurate diagnosis. Aim: Developing the first gene panel in Europe utilizing the 23 most relevant thyroid oncogenes with 568 mutations. Method: Examination of the isolated DNA from biopsy samples by Ion Torrent new generation sequencing. Results: The validation of our method was performed on tumor tissue samples, in which 127 genetic variations were identified, yet unknown in thyroid tumors. AXIN1 was the most polymorphic gene, while BRAF c.1799T>A (V600E) was the most frequently identified mutation. We detected 36 clinically relevant variants, 75% of which have not been described in the literature. Six of our 8 cytologically malignant and 8 of our 14 indeterminate as well as 20 of our 28 cytologically benign samples were identified as containing pathologic variants in a driver gene (BRAF c.1799T>A, NRAS c.181C>A). Conclusion: We have developed a validated, reliable new generation sequencing-based method with high positive predictive value (89%) and sensitivity (79%), suitable for the early detection of malignant lesions in the thyroid.

ID:31492174|Title:The first report of molecular characterized BRD4-NUT carcinoma in Brazil: a case report.Abstract:BACKGROUND: NUT midline carcinoma is a rare and aggressive subset of squamous cell carcinoma, which is characterized by the translocation of nuclear protein in testis gene that is mostly fused with bromodomain and extraterminal family proteins. We describe here the first Brazilian case of NUT midline carcinoma with BRD4-NUT fusion detected in a next-generation sequencing panel and we present the clinical evolution of this patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old Caucasian man was diagnosed with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left maxillary sinus, with negative in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr encoding region and human papillomavirus genotyping. He received induction therapy, chemoradiotherapy with weekly systemic chemotherapy, and, concurrently, weekly intra-arterial chemotherapy. New imaging evaluation, 1 month after the end of the last treatment, revealed a good partial response in the primary lesion. However, positron emission tomography-computed tomography showed multiple suspicious lesions in his bones and lungs, which were histologically confirmed. He died exactly 2 months after metastatic disease was diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: NUT midline carcinoma is usually very aggressive. Currently, there is no standard of care for treatment of NUT midline carcinoma. The definitive diagnosis must be by demonstration of NUTM1 rearrangement. Immunohistochemical staining of greater than 50% of tumor nuclei on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using the monoclonal rabbit antibody to NUT (clone C52B1), has a specificity of 100%, and sensitivity of 87% for the diagnosis of NUT midline carcinoma. Our case is the first Brazilian case of NUT midline carcinoma with BRD4-NUT fusion.|Cancer
ID:31498304|Title:In Vivo Inhibition of MicroRNA to Decrease Tumor Growth in Mice.Abstract:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression through their ability to destabilize mRNA and inhibit translation of target mRNAs. An ever-increasing number of studies have identified miRNAs as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and also as therapeutic targets, adding an extra dimension to cancer evaluation and treatment. In the context of thyroid cancer, tumorigenesis results not only from mutations in important genes, but also from the overexpression of many miRNAs. Accordingly, the role of miRNAs in the control of thyroid gene expression is evolving as an important mechanism in cancer. Herein, we present a protocol to examine the effects of miRNA-inhibitor delivery as a therapeutic modality in thyroid cancer using human tumor xenograft and orthotopic mouse models. After engineering stable thyroid tumoral cells expressing GFP and luciferase, cells are injected into nude mice to develop tumors, which can be followed by bioluminescence. The in vivo inhibition of a miRNA can reduce tumor growth and upregulate miRNA gene targets. This method can be used to assess the importance of a determined miRNA in vivo, in addition to identifying new therapeutic targets.|Cancer
ID:31505033|Title:Histopathological evaluation of minor salivary gland papillary-cystic tumours: focus on genetic alterations in sialadenoma papilliferum and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.Abstract:AIMS: Minor salivary gland tumours showing a predominant papillary-cystic structure are rare, and constitute a mixture of various types of neoplasm; thus, the histopathological assessment of these tumours poses a significant diagnostic challenge. We aimed to delineate the histological characteristics of these tumours and further mutational aspects with a particular focus on sialadenoma papilliferum (SP) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrieved 28 papillary-cystic tumours of the minor salivary glands, and performed histological re-evaluation and mutation analyses of several key oncogenes. The histological classifications were as follows: SP (n = 10), SP-like intraductal papillary tumour (SP-IPT) (n = 2), IPMN (n = 9), intraductal papilloma, cystadenoma, and cystadenocarcinoma (two, three and two respectively). Whereas SP typically consisted of a combination of exophytic squamous epithelium and endophytic intraductal papillary infoldings, SP-IPT lacked the exophytic component. SP and SP-IPT frequently harboured BRAF V600E mutations (75.0%), which were identified in both squamous and ductal components. IPMN was characterised by a well-demarcated cystic lesion filled exclusively with a papillary proliferation of mucinous cells and a high rate of AKT1 E17K mutations (88.9%). Intraductal papillomas were unilocular cystic lesions with intraluminal papillary growth of bland columnar cells. In contrast, both cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas showed a multicystic appearance with a papillary configuration. Cystadenocarcinomas invaded the surrounding tissue and were composed of markedly atypical tumour cells. CONCLUSION: The appropriate interpretation of histological findings and specific genetic alterations (e.g. BRAF V600E and AKT1 E17K in SP and IPMN) would be useful for the correct diagnosis of minor salivary gland papillary-cystic tumours.|Cancer
ID:31507098|Title:Efficacy of EGFR-TKIs with or without upfront brain radiotherapy for EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with central nervous system metastases.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Although the clinical efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients has been demonstrated, their efficacy in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and the role of radiotherapy remain unclear. This study aimed to determine if it is preferable to add upfront cranial radiotherapy to EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with newly diagnosed brain metastases. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with CNS metastases who received EGFR-TKIs as a first-line therapy. RESULTS: A total of 104 patients were enrolled and 39 patients received upfront brain radiotherapy, while 65 patients received first and second generation EGFR-TKIs first. The median time to treatment failure (TTF) was 7.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.3-9.4). The median survival time (MST) was 24.0 months (95% CI: 20.1-30.1). The overall response rate of the CNS was 37%. The median CNS progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.2 months (95% CI: 10.0-16.2). Brain radiotherapy prior to EGFR-TKI prolonged TTF (11.2 vs. 6.8 months, P = 0.038) and tended to prolong CNS-PFS (15.6 vs. 11.1 months, P = 0.096) but was not significantly associated with overall survival (MST 26.1 vs. 24.0 months, P = 0.525). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that poor performance status and the presence of extracranial metastases were poor prognostic factors related to overall survival. CONCLUSION: EGFR-TKI showed a favorable effect for EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with CNS metastases. Prolonged TTF and CNS-PFS were observed with upfront brain radiotherapy.|Cancer
ID:31511296|Title:Mutated RAS: Targeting the "Untargetable" with T Cells.Abstract:The RAS family of proteins is at the apex of several pathways implicated in a multitude of epithelial cancers but has remained stubbornly resistant to the wave of targeted small molecules and antibodies that have revolutionized clinical oncology. KRAS, the most commonly mutated of the isoforms, represents an attractive target for treatment, given its ubiquity, central role as a driver mutation, and association with poor prognosis. This review is a comprehensive summary of the existing approaches to targeting KRAS spanning small-molecule inhibitors, cancer vaccines, and with a focus on trials in adoptive cell therapy. Here we explain how the limitations of existing drugs and nonspecific immune-based therapies are circumvented with techniques in modern immunotherapy. The successes outlined represent the most promising path to finally targeting the prototypical "undruggable" RAS oncogene family.|Cancer
ID:31512231|Title:Exosome DNA: Critical regulator of tumor immunity and a diagnostic biomarker.Abstract:Nanosized cellular vesicles "exosome" contains a variety of biological cargo including DNA fragments from cell-of-origin. Despite its biological stability and clinical utility in tumor diagnosis, exosome DNA (ExoDNA) is very little studied as compare with exosome RNA. Cytoplasmic accumulation of damaged DNA from nucleus and mitochondria often leads to its packaging in exosomes by yet unknown pathways. ExoDNA modulates tumor immunity via paracrine interactions and activation of cytosolic DNA sensor pathways, for example, STING, cGAS, and so forth in specific immune cell subsets. In addition to priming tumor immunity, ExoDNA is also emerging as a critical regulator of check-point immunotherapy. As a useful diagnostic biomaterial, ExoDNA contains a variety of clinically relevant tumor-specific mutations representing multiple genes (e.g., EGFR, BRAF, RAS, IDH, and HER2), thus making it a promising "liquid biopsy" material for therapy recommendations. Hence, ExoDNA in addition to tumor immunity modulation, is also emerging as a suitable diagnostic material for personalized therapy in cancer. Here, we review the current status of ExoDNA research and its potential uses in tumor biology.|Cancer
ID:31515871|Title:Cryptic recurrent ACIN1-NUTM1 fusions in non-KMT2A-rearranged infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Abstract:Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) are rare hematological malignancies occurring in children younger than 1 year of age, most frequently associated with KMT2A rearrangements (KMT2A-r). The smaller subset without KMT2A-r, which represents 20% of infant ALL cases, is poorly characterized. Here we report two cases of chemotherapy-sensitive non-KMT2A-r infant ALL. Transcriptome analyses revealed identical ACIN1-NUTM1 gene fusions in both cases, derived from cryptic chromosomal rearrangements undetected by standard cytogenetic approaches. Two isoforms of the gene fusion, joining exons 3 or 4 of ACIN1 to exon 3 of NUTM1, were identified. Both fusion transcripts contained the functional DNA-binding SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) domain of ACIN1 and most of NUTM1. The detection of the ACIN1-NUTM1 fusion by RT-PCR allowed the molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease in a clinical setting. Based on publicly available genomic datasets and literature review, we predict that NUTM1 gene fusions are recurrent events in infant ALL. As such, we propose two clinically relevant assays to screen for NUTM1 rearrangements in bone marrow cells, independent of the fusion partner: NUMT1 immunohistochemistry and NUTM1 RNA expression. In sum, our study identifies ACIN1-NUTM1 as a recurrent and possibly cryptic fusion in non-KMT2A-r infant ALL, provides clinical tools to screen for NUTM1-rearranged leukemia and contributes to the refinement of this new subgroup.|Cancer
ID:31516752|Title:Loss of PSP94 expression is associated with early PSA recurrence and deteriorates outcome of PTEN deleted prostate cancers.Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94) is a target gene of the EZH2 transcriptional repressor and is often downregulated in prostate cancer; however, its prognostic value is disputed. METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray of 12, 432 prostate cancer specimens was performed to evaluate PSP94 expression. Correlation of PSP94 expression with tumor phenotype, patient prognosis, TMPRSS2:ERG fusion status, EZH2 expression and PTEN deletion was studied. RESULTS: PSP94 expression was increased in benign prostatic hyperplasia; however, it was downregulated in 48% and negative in 42% of the 9, 881 interpretable prostate cancer specimens. The loss of PSP94 expression was inversely correlated to EZH2 expression (P < 0.0001) and largely unrelated to the ERG status, but strongly correlated with high Gleason grade, advanced tumor stage, and nodal metastasis ( P <0.0001 each). The fraction of PSP94-negative cancer specimens increased from 40% in pT2 to 52% in pT3b-pT4 ( P < 0.0001) and from 40% in Gleason 3+3 = 6 to 46% in Gleason 4+3 = 7 and 60% in Gleason >=4+4 = 8 ( P < 0.0001). Loss of PSP94 was linked to early prostate-specific antigen recurrence, but with little absolute effect ( P < 0.0001). However, it provided additional prognostic impact in cancer specimens with PTEN deletion. Loss of PSP94 deteriorated prognosis of cancer patients with PTEN deletion by more than 10% (P < 0.0001). The combination of PTEN deletion and PSP94 loss provided independent prognostic information that was observed in several subgroups defined by classical and quantitative Gleason grade. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that combined PSP94/PTEN analysis can be potentially used in the clinical prognosis of prostate cancer.|Cancer
ID:31521947|Title:Rectal cancer sub-clones respond differentially to neoadjuvant therapy.Abstract:Treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer includes chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery but patient responses to neoadjuvant treatment are variable. We have shown that rectal tumors are comprised of multiple genetically distinct sub-clones. Unique sub-clones within tumors may harbor mutations which contribute to inter-patient variation in response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Analysis of the influence of nCRT on the extent and nature of intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity in rectal cancer may provide insights into mechanisms of resistance. Locally advanced rectal cancer patients underwent pre-treatment biopsies. At the time of surgery, tissue from the treated tumor was obtained and analyzed. Pre- and post-treatment specimens were subjected to whole exome and confirmatory deep sequencing for somatic mutations. Copy number variation was assessed using OncoScan SNP arrays. Genomic data were analyzed using PyClone to identify sub-clonal tumor population following nCRT. Alterations that persisted or were enriched in the post-treatment tumor specimen following nCRT were defined for each patient. Thirty-two samples were obtained from ten patients. PyClone identified 2 to 10 genetic sub-clones per tumor. Substantial changes in the proportions of individual sub-clones in pre- versus post-treatment tumor material were found in all patients. Resistant sub-clones recurrently contained mutations in TP53, APC, ABCA13, MUC16, and THSD4. Recurrent copy number variation was observed across multiple chromosome regions after nCRT. Pathway analysis including variant alleles and copy number changes associated with resistant sub-clones revealed significantly altered pathways, especially those linked to the APC and TP53 genes, which were the two most frequently mutated genes. Intra-tumoral heterogeneity is evident in pre-treatment rectal cancer. Following treatment, sub-clonal populations are selectively modified and enrichment of a subset of pre-treatment sub-clones is seen. Further studies are needed to define recurrent alterations at diagnosis that may contribute to resistance to nCRT.|Cancer
ID:31527860|Title:Declining detection rates for APC and biallelic MUTYH variants in polyposis patients, implications for DNA testing policy.Abstract:This study aimed to determine the prevalence of APC-associated familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) in a large cohort, taking into account factors as adenoma count and year of diagnosis. All application forms used to send patients in for APC and MUTYH variant analysis between 1992 and 2017 were collected (n = 2082). Using the data provided on the application form, the APC and biallelic MUTYH prevalence was determined and possible predictive factors were examined using multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis in SPSS. The prevalence of disease causing variants in the APC gene significantly increases with adenoma count while MAP shows a peak prevalence in individuals with 50-99 adenomas. Logistic regression analysis shows significant odds ratios for adenoma count, age at diagnosis, and, interestingly, a decline in the chance of finding a variant in either gene over time. Moreover, in 22% (43/200) of patients with FAP-related extracolonic manifestations a variant was identified. The overall detection rates are above 10% for patients with >10 adenomas aged <60 and >20 adenomas aged <70. Patients with variants outside these criteria had FAP-related extracolonic manifestations, colorectal cancer aged <40, somatic KRAS c.34G > T variant in the tumor or a first-degree relative with >10 adenomas. Therefore, APC and MUTYH testing in patients with >10 adenomas aged <60 and with >20 adenomas aged <70 is advised. Almost all FAP and MAP patients not meeting these criteria showed other characteristics that can be used as an indication to prompt genetic testing.|Cancer
ID:31530409|Title:[Hepatic epithelioid angiomyolipoma/PEComa and focal nodular hyperplasia in a patient with a previous history of cutaneous melanoma].Abstract:Hepatic perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are uncommon mesenchymal neoplasms. PEComas concurrent with other hepatic lesions is a very rare occurrence, with only two previously reported cases. We report a primary hepatic PEComa associated with focal nodular hyperplasia in a patient with a previous history of cutaneous melanoma. Diagnostic imaging studies suggested a hepatic adenoma and the patient underwent a segmentectomy. The tumor was mainly composed of epithelioid cells, adipose tissue and smooth muscle fibers intermixed with blood vessels. The neoplastic cells were diffusely immunoreactive for HMB-45, Melan-A and smooth muscle actin, but not for Hepatocyte, S100, MITF or BRAF. Molecular studies were negative for BRAFV600 mutation. The final diagnosis was hepatic epithelioid angiomyolipoma/PEComa. The differential diagnosis of hepatic PEComa is discussed.|Cancer
ID:31533138|Title:[Predictive markers of immunotherapy of colorectal cancer].Abstract:Colorectal carcinomas are heterogeneous in their morphologic, immunologic and molecular aspects. The smooth and sharply demarcated medullary carcinomas present with an expansive border and high tumor stroma ratio. The high load of cancer neoantigens as a consequence of microsatellite instability results in numerous reactive regional lymph nodes. In contrast, the low grade, MSS type carcinomas are spiculated, desmoplastic and hard, frequently with smaller and sometimes also desmoplastic lymph node metastases. This macroscopic and histological heterogeneity is mirrored on the immunohistochemical and molecular level and is decisive from prognostic and predictive point of view. As immunotherapy opened a new front in the therapy of colorectal cancer, the pathology report has to quantify and qualify the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, the peritumoral and intratumoral lymphoid infiltration and tumor stroma ratio in order to improve patient selection.|Cancer
ID:31534167|Title:Non-hematopoietic STAT6 induces epithelial tight junction dysfunction and promotes intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis.Abstract:Enhanced gut permeability due to dysregulated epithelial tight junction is often associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which have a greater risk for developing colorectal cancer. STAT6 activation was detected in inflamed colonic epithelium of active IBD patients, suggesting a role of epithelial STAT6 in colitis development. Here, we demonstrated that non-hematopoietic STAT6, but not hematopoietic STAT6, triggered DSS-induced colitis and subsequent tumorigenesis. This could be due to the enhancing-effect of STAT6 on gut permeability and microbiota translocation via interruption of epithelial tight junction integrity. Mechanistically, long-myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK1) was identified as a target of STAT6, leading to epithelial tight junction dysfunction and microbiota-driven colitis. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-13, which was primarily derived from type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in a microbiota-dependent way, inhibited epithelial STAT6 activation and improved gut permeability and DSS-induced colitis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT6 reduces murine intestinal tumor formation, and tumoral p-STAT6 levels positively correlated to the clinical stage and poor prognosis of human colorectal cancer. Thus, our study reveals a direct role of STAT6 in the disruption of epithelial tight junction integrity and colitis development, and suggests STAT6 as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic target for IBD and colitis-associated cancer.|Cancer
ID:31538107|Title:Malignant struma ovarii presenting with follicular carcinoma: A case report with molecular analysis.Abstract:Malignant struma ovarii presenting with follicular carcinoma is extremely rare, and its mechanism of tumorigenesis remains unknown. Here, we present a case of malignant struma ovarii with peritoneal dissemination of follicular carcinoma, for which a molecular analysis for major oncogenic gene alterations in follicular thyroid carcinoma was performed. A 39-year-old nulliparous woman was referred with a diagnosis of highly differentiated follicular carcinoma of ovarian origin. Primary thyroid cancer was not diagnosed, and she had a normal thyroid function. 123I scintigraphy revealed multiple peritoneal dissemination that was surgically resected. Histologically, the tumor consisted of numerous follicles without nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Tumor samples were investigated for 50 cancer-related genes, including RAS, BRAF, and p53, and PPARg-PAX8 gene fusion by targeted DNA sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization, respectively. No major oncogenic gene alterations were detected. These negative findings suggest a different mechanism of tumorigenesis from that of adult-type follicular thyroid carcinoma.|Cancer
ID:31539535|Title:Estrogen signaling and estrogen receptors as prognostic indicators in laryngeal cancer.Abstract:Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) has been shown to respond to 17beta-estradiol. However, the presence and characterization of estrogen receptors (ER) and other sex hormone receptors in LSCC are still being determined. Sex hormone receptors and the way sex hormones impact LSCC tumors are important for understanding which patients would benefit from hormone therapies, such as anti-estrogen therapies. This information also has prognostic value, as there may be a correlation between ER profiles and LSCC aggression. Recent work by our team and others has shown that the canonical ER, estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), and its splice variant ERalpha36, are important modulators of estrogen signaling in LSCC. This review describes some common 17beta-estradiol signaling pathways, and explains how these signaling pathways might control LSCC tumor growth. We also show that loss of ERalpha, but not ERalpha36, imbues LSCC with enhanced aggression, a pattern which has previously only been observed in breast cancer. We make a case for using ERalpha as a tumorigenic modulator and pathogenic marker in LSCC on par with the use of ERalpha as a prognostic marker in breast cancer.|Cancer
ID:31540291|Title:Next-Generation Sequencing Improves Diagnosis, Prognosis and Clinical Management of Myeloid Neoplasms.Abstract:Molecular diagnosis of myeloid neoplasms (MN) is based on the detection of multiple genetic alterations using various techniques. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been proved as a useful method for analyzing many genes simultaneously. In this context, we analyzed diagnostic samples from 121 patients affected by MN and ten relapse samples from a subset of acute myeloid leukemia patients using two enrichment-capture NGS gene panels. Pathogenicity classification of variants was enhanced by the development and application of a custom onco-hematology score. A total of 278 pathogenic variants were detected in 84% of patients. For structural alterations, 82% of those identified by cytogenetics were detected by NGS, 25 of 31 copy number variants and three out of three translocations. The detection of variants using NGS changed the diagnosis of seven patients and the prognosis of 15 patients and enabled us to identify 44 suitable candidates for clinical trials. Regarding AML, six of the ten relapsed patients lost or gained variants, comparing with diagnostic samples. In conclusion, the use of NGS panels in MN improves genetic characterization of the disease compared with conventional methods, thus demonstrating its potential clinical utility in routine clinical testing. This approach leads to better-adjusted treatments for each patient.|Cancer
ID:31546041|Title:EURACAN/IASLC Proposals for Updating the Histologic Classification of Pleural Mesothelioma: Towards a More Multidisciplinary Approach.Abstract:INTRODUCTION: Molecular and immunologic breakthroughs are transforming the management of thoracic cancer, although advances have not been as marked for malignant pleural mesothelioma where pathologic diagnosis has been essentially limited to three histologic subtypes. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group (pathologists, molecular biologists, surgeons, radiologists, and oncologists), sponsored by European Network for Rare Adult Solid Cancers/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, met in 2018 to critically review the current classification. RESULTS: Recommendations include: (1) classification should be updated to include architectural patterns and stromal and cytologic features that refine prognostication; (2) subject to data accrual, malignant mesothelioma in situ could be an additional category; (3) grading of epithelioid malignant pleural mesotheliomas should be routinely undertaken; (4) favorable/unfavorable histologic characteristics should be routinely reported; (5) clinically relevant molecular data (programmed death ligand 1, BRCA 1 associated protein 1 [BAP1], and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) should be incorporated into reports, if undertaken; (6) other molecular data should be accrued as part of future trials; (7) resection specimens (i.e., extended pleurectomy/decortication and extrapleural pneumonectomy) should be pathologically staged with smaller specimens being clinically staged; (8) ideally, at least three separate areas should be sampled from the pleural cavity, including areas of interest identified on pre-surgical imaging; (9) image-acquisition protocols/imaging terminology should be standardized to aid research/refine clinical staging; (10) multidisciplinary tumor boards should include pathologists to ensure appropriate treatment options are considered; (11) all histologic subtypes should be considered potential candidates for chemotherapy; (12) patients with sarcomatoid or biphasic mesothelioma should not be excluded from first-line clinical trials unless there is a compelling reason; (13) tumor subtyping should be further assessed in relation to duration of response to immunotherapy; and (14) systematic screening of all patients for germline mutations is not recommended, in the absence of a family history suspicious for BAP1 syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: These multidisciplinary recommendations for pathology classification and application will allow more informative pathologic reporting and potential risk stratification, to support clinical practice, research investigation and clinical trials.|Cancer
ID:31547595|Title:Cytogenetics and Cytogenomics Evaluation in Cancer.Abstract:The availability of cytogenetics and cytogenomics technologies improved the detection and identification of tumor molecular signatures as well as the understanding of cancer initiation and progression. The use of large-scale and high-throughput cytogenomics technologies has led to a fast identification of several cancer candidate biomarkers associated with diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics. The advent of array comparative genomic hybridization and next-generation sequencing technologies has significantly improved the knowledge about cancer biology, underlining driver genes to guide targeted therapy development, drug-resistance prediction, and pharmacogenetics. However, few of these candidate biomarkers have made the transition to the clinic with a clear benefit for the patients. Technological progress helped to demonstrate that cellular heterogeneity plays a significant role in tumor progression and resistance/sensitivity to cancer therapies, representing the major challenge of precision cancer therapy. A paradigm shift has been introduced in cancer genomics with the recent advent of single-cell sequencing, since it presents a lot of applications with a clear benefit to oncological patients, namely, detection of intra-tumoral heterogeneity, mapping clonal evolution, monitoring the development of therapy resistance, and detection of rare tumor cell populations. It seems now evident that no single biomarker could provide the whole information necessary to early detect and predict the behavior and prognosis of tumors. The promise of precision medicine is based on the molecular profiling of tumors being vital the continuous progress of high-throughput technologies and the multidisciplinary efforts to catalogue chromosomal rearrangements and genomic alterations of human cancers and to do a good interpretation of the relation genotype-phenotype.|Cancer
ID:31555790|Title:Sensing of circulating cancer biomarkers with metal nanoparticles.Abstract:The analysis of circulating cancer biomarkers, including cell-free and circulating tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, microRNA and exosomes, holds promise in revolutionizing cancer diagnosis and prognosis using body fluid analysis, also known as liquid biopsy. To enable clinical application of these biomarkers, new analytical tools capable of detecting them in very low concentrations in complex sample matrixes are needed. Metal nanoparticles have emerged as extraordinary analytical scaffolds because of their unique optoelectronic properties and ease of functionalization. Hence, multiple analytical techniques have been developed based on these nanoparticles and their plasmonic properties. The aim of this review is to summarize and discuss the present development on the use of metal nanoparticles for the analysis of circulating cancer biomarkers. We examine how metal nanoparticles can be used as (1) analytical transducers in various sensing principles, such as aggregation induced colorimetric assays, plasmon resonance energy transfer, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and refractive index sensing, and (2) signal amplification elements in surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and electrochemical detection. We critically discuss the clinical relevance of each category of circulating biomarkers, followed by a thorough analysis of how these nanoparticle-based designs have overcome some of the main challenges that gold standard analytical techniques currently face, and what new directions the field may take in the future.|Cancer
ID:31558473|Title:Analysis of Biomarkers and Association With Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Subanalysis of the Sorafenib Phase III DECISION Trial.Abstract:PURPOSE: The phase III DECISION trial (NCT00984282; EudraCT:2009-012007-25) established sorafenib efficacy in locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) refractory to radioactive iodine. We conducted a retrospective, exploratory biomarker analysis of patients from DECISION. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Candidate biomarkers [15 baseline plasma proteins, baseline and during-treatment serum thyroglobulin, and relevant tumor mutations (BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS)] were analyzed for correlation with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Plasma biomarker and thyroglobulin data were available for 395 of 417 (94.7%) and 403 of 417 (96.6%) patients, respectively. Elevated baseline VEGFA was independently associated with poor prognosis for progression-free survival [PFS; HR = 1.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.38-2.44; P = 0.0007], overall survival (HR = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.37-3.36; P = 0.013), and disease-control rate (DCR; OR = 0.30; P = 0.009). Elevated baseline thyroglobulin was independently associated with poor PFS (HR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.52-2.71; P < 0.0001) and DCR (OR = 0.32; P = 0.01). Combined VEGFA/thyroglobulin signatures correlated with poor PFS (HR = 2.12; 95% CI, 1.57-2.87; P < 0.00001). Thyroglobulin decrease >=30% from baseline was achieved by 76% and 14% of patients receiving sorafenib and placebo, respectively (P < 0.001). Patients with >=30% thyroglobulin reduction had longer PFS than those without >=30% reduction [HR (95% CI): sorafenib = 0.61 (0.40-0.94), P = 0.022; placebo = 0.49 (0.29-0.85), P = 0.009]. BRAF mutations were associated with better PFS; RAS mutations were associated with worse PFS, although neither was independently prognostic in multivariate models. No examined biomarker predicted sorafenib benefit. CONCLUSIONS: We identified biomarkers associated with poor prognosis in DTC, including elevated baseline VEGFA and thyroglobulin and the presence of RAS mutations. Serum thyroglobulin may be a biomarker of tumor response and progression.|Cancer
ID:31561847|Title:[Identification and management of patients with Lynch syndrome].Abstract:About 5% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases occurred in the context of an underlying hereditary predisposition syndrome. Lynch syndrome is the main causes of hereditary CRC but is also associated with a higher risk of other cancers (such as endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer). It is the consequence of constitutional mutation in a MisMatch Repair (MMR) gene, involved in DNA repair: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2; or of the EPCAM gene (MSH2 promotor). If a mutation predisposing to Lynch Syndrome is identified in an individual, special monitoring should be initiated, adapted to estimated cancer risk. Clinical criteria (Amsterdam II and Bethesda) have been validated to identify the patients who should be referred for genetic counseling in order to initiate constitutional DNA testing. Furthermore, the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) systematically recommend tumoral testing looking for MMR system failure in case of CRC diagnosed under 60, endometrial cancer diagnosed under 50 or whatever the age in patients diagnosed with CRC or endometrial cancer harbouring personal or familal history of Lunch Syndrome cancers. In this review, we will discuss how to detect Lynch syndrome (identification of the index case and family screening) and how to monitor it in 2019.|Cancer
ID:31569934|Title:Modern view on epidermal dysplasia carcinogenesis.Abstract:Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin develops from the spectrum of facultative precancerous conditions, which in the course of malignant transformation through cancer stage in situ without early treatment fully transform into invasive squamous cell carcinoma. According to classical model of carcinogenesis, the transformation of actinic keratosis into squamous cell carcinoma of the skin occurs due to a mutation in one gene, more often a tumor suppressor, and undergoes a stage of development with lack of control of cell cycle. The aim of the research is to supplement current knowledge of genetic determination of pathogenetic mechanisms of epidermal dysplasia of the skin by studying the genetic determinant in the skin lesion of varying degrees of malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 85 skin bioptates of patients with epidermal dysplasia of the skin (Gr 1 - 43 patients with actinic keratosis; Gr 2 - 21 patients with non-invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; Gr 3 - 21 patients with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) by molecular genetic testing of gene polymorphisms: TP53 (G13494A), L-myc (T3109G), TNF-alpha (G308A) in tumor tissue. The histological examination revealed the levels of dysplasia of the epidermis. RESULTS: In case of the same disease duration in patients of Gr1/Gr3, L-myc (3109TT) is a genetic component of malignant transformation of epithelial skin cells (p = 0.004) and the development of invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Other variants of 3109TG and 3109GG genes do not have such prognostic value for the risk of skin cancer compared to 3109TT. Significant differences were found in the distribution of (13494GA) when comparing Gr 1 with Gr 3 (p = 0.014) and Gr 2 with Gr 3 (p = 0.038). A significant increase in the distribution of 13494GA genotype was revealed in patients with invasive form of keratinocyte intraepidermal neoplasia. 13494A allele was more likely to be detected in patients of Gr 3 compared to Gr 2 (p = 0.030) that proves the association of this allele with the development of invasive malignancies of the skin. The association of 308GG genotype and TNF-alpha (308G) allele with the development of malignant skin lesions was found. Comparing the distribution of 308G allele in patients of Gr 1 and Gr 2, we found its significant increase in patients of Gr 1. Comparative analysis of gene polymorphism with tumor invasion level showed a significant difference only in 308GG genotype between patients with grade III of KIN (keratinocyte intraepidermal neoplasia) in Gr 2 and patients with KIN III of Gr 1 (p = 0.007), and 308GA between patients with KIN III of Gr 2 and KIN III of Gr 1 (p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Our work has supplemented modern vision of genetic component in pathogenetic mechanism of the development of epidermal dysplasia of the skin. Thus, the association of L-myc (3109TT) with the development of malignant skin lesions of different invasiveness and the modifying effect of TNF-alpha (G308A) and TP53 (G13494A) gene variants on pathological transformation in the focus of EDS depending on the level of epithelial dysplasia was revealed.|Cancer
ID:31570430|Title:Promoter Methylation Down-regulates B-cell Translocation Gene 1 Expression in Breast Carcinoma.Abstract:BACKGROUND/AIM: The mechanism responsible for B-cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1) down-regulation in breast carcinoma remains unknown. We examined the BTG1 expression status in breast carcinoma cells and investigated the mechanism underlying the observed alterations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four breast carcinoma cell lines (SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, T-47D, and MCF-7), and one normal mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) were analyzed. BTG1 expression was examined using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot. Methylation status of the BTG1 promoter was analyzed using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). To investigate the effect of methylation on BTG1, the cells were treated with a demethylating agent. RESULTS: The carcinoma cells expressed significantly lower levels of BTG1 mRNA and protein than normal cells. The BTG1 promoter was highly methylated in the carcinoma cells. 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine significantly restored BTG1 expression. CONCLUSION: Down-regulation of BTG1 expression through epigenetic repression is involved in mammary carcinogenesis. BTG1 is a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for breast carcinoma.|Cancer
ID:31571071|Title:Optimized immunohistochemical detection of estrogen receptor beta using two validated monoclonal antibodies confirms its expression in normal and malignant breast tissues.Abstract:PURPOSE: Significant controversy exists regarding the expression patterns of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) in normal and diseased breast tissue. To address this issue, we have validated two ERbeta antibodies, optimized the IHC protocols for both antibodies and now report the expression patterns of ERbeta in normal and malignant breast tissues. METHODS: ERbeta antibody specificity was determined using western blot and IHC analysis. ERbeta protein expression patterns were assessed via IHC in normal breast tissue and invasive breast carcinoma. Further, we report the detailed protocol of the ERbeta IHC assay developed in our CAP/CLIA certified laboratory to provide a standardized method for future studies. RESULTS: We have confirmed the specificity of two independent ERbeta monoclonal antibodies, one that detects total (i.e., full length plus splice variants 2-5, which do not include the ligand binding domain) ERbeta protein (PPZ0506) and one that detects only the full-length form, which includes the ligand binding domain, of ERbeta (PPG5/10). Using these two antibodies, we demonstrate that ERbeta is highly expressed in normal human breast tissue as well as in 20-30% of invasive breast cancers. Further, these two antibodies exhibited similar staining patterns across multiple different tissues and were highly concordant with regard to determining ERbeta positivity in breast cancers. CONCLUSIONS: ERbeta protein was shown to be abundant in the majority of normal breast epithelial cells and is present in 20-30% of breast cancers. Use of these two antibodies, along with their standardized IHC protocols, provide a reference for future studies aimed at determining the utility of ERbeta as a prognostic and/or predictive biomarker in various tissues of benign or malignant states.|Cancer
ID:31577852|Title:Longitudinal analysis of a secondary BRCA2 mutation using digital droplet PCR.Abstract:Development of resistance to platinum and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors via secondary BRCA gene mutations that restore functional homologous recombination has been observed in a number of cancer types. Here we report a case of somatic BRCA2 mutation in a patient with high grade serous ovarian carcinoma. A secondary mutation predicted to restore the BRCA2 open reading frame was detected at low frequency (2.3%) in whole exome sequencing of a peritoneal biopsy at disease progression after treatment that included carboplatin and olaparib. We used digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to verify the presence and frequency of this mutation in the biopsy sample at progression and also used this approach to assess the presence of the secondary mutation in preceding biopsies at diagnosis and first relapse. We found no evidence for the secondary mutation being present prior to the final progression biopsy, suggesting that this mutation was acquired late in the course of treatment. ddPCR provides a sensitive and specific technique to investigate the presence of low frequency mutations in a time series of biopsies.|Cancer

ID:31587141|Title:Kabuki syndrome: review of the clinical features, diagnosis and epigenetic mechanisms.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Kabuki syndrome (KS), is a infrequent inherited malformation syndrome caused by mutations in a H3 lysine 4 methylase (KMT2D) or an X-linked histone H3 lysine 27 demethylase (UTX/KDM6A). The characteristics in patients with KS have not yet been well recognized. DATA SOURCES: We used databases including PubMed and Google Scholar to search for publications about the clinical features and the etiology of Kabuki syndrome. The most relevant articles to the scope of this review were chosen for analysis. RESULTS: Clinical diagnosis of KS is challenging in initial period, because many clinical characteristics become apparent only in subsequent years. Recently, the genetic and functional interaction between KS-associated genes and their products have been elucidated. New clinical findings were reported including nervous system and intellectual performance, endocrine-related disorders and immune deficiency and autoimmune disease. Cancer risks of Kabuki syndrome was reviewed. Meanwhile, we discussed the Kabuki-like syndrome. Digital clinical genetic service, such as dysmorphology database can improve availability and provide high-quality diagnostic services. Given the significant clinical relevance of KS-associated genes and epigenetic modifications crosstalk, efforts in the research for new mechanisms are thus of maximum interest. CONCLUSIONS: Kabuki syndrome has a strong clinical and biological heterogeneity. The main pathogenesis of Kabuki syndrome is the imbalance between switch-on and -off of the chromatin. The direction of drug research may be to regulate the normal opening of chromatin. Small molecule inhibitors of histone deacetylases maybe helpful in treatment of mental retardation and reduce cancer risk in KS.|Cancer
ID:31592503|Title:Integrative Molecular Analysis of Patients With Advanced and Metastatic Cancer.Abstract:PURPOSE: We developed a precision medicine program for patients with advanced cancer using integrative whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred fifteen patients with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors were prospectively enrolled, and paired tumor/normal sequencing was performed. Seven hundred fifty-nine tumors from 515 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Most frequent tumor types were prostate (19.4%), brain (16.5%), bladder (15.4%), and kidney cancer (9.2%). Most frequently altered genes were TP53 (33%), CDKN2A (11%), APC (10%), KTM2D (8%), PTEN (8%), and BRCA2 (8%). Pathogenic germline alterations were present in 10.7% of patients, most frequently CHEK2 (1.9%), BRCA1 (1.5%), BRCA2 (1.5%), and MSH6 (1.4%). Novel gene fusions were identified, including a RBM47-CDK12 fusion in a metastatic prostate cancer sample. The rate of clinically relevant alterations was 39% by whole-exome sequencing, which was improved by 16% by adding RNA sequencing. In patients with more than one sequenced tumor sample (n = 146), 84.62% of actionable mutations were concordant. CONCLUSION: Integrative analysis may uncover informative alterations for an advanced pan-cancer patient population. These alterations are consistent in spatially and temporally heterogeneous samples.|Cancer
ID:31596728|Title:A molecular sub-cluster of colon cancer cells with low VDR expression is sensitive to chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors and PI3K-mTOR inhibitors treatment.Abstract:Gene expression based consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) sub-clusters are robust colon cancer classification systems. Although, the molecular features are clear, colon cancer subgroups based interventions are limited. To address this problem, we analyze the CMS and NMF subgroup guided drug sensitivity in colon cancer cell lines. CMS3 subtype cells are sensitive to 5-Fluorouracil, while, CMS4 subtype cells are sensitive to cisplatin treatment. In NMF classification, a sub-cluster is specifically sensitive to chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors, PI3K-mTOR inhibitors and NOTCH inhibitor treatment. This sub-cluster has low frequency of TP53, POLE, PIK3CA and BRAF mutation. Transcriptional analysis demonstrates low NOTCH signaling activity, low CDX2 and VDR expression in this sub-cluster. CDX2 and VDR are significantly associated with the sensitivity of chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors and PI3K-mTOR inhibitors. Moreover, a positive correlation between VDR and CDX2 is identified. VDR and CDX2 mediated regulatory networks are constructed. At last, three or four sub-clusters classification is validated in colon cancer patients. Overall, our results suggest a molecular sub-cluster of colon cancer cells with low CDX2 and VDR expression is sensitive to chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors and PI3K-mTOR inhibitors treatment and provide an example of translation of cancer classification to subgroup guided therapies.|Cancer
ID:31597339|Title:Clinical Practice Use of Liquid Biopsy to Identify RAS/BRAF Mutations in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC): A Single Institution Experience.Abstract:Tumor heterogeneity represents a possible cause of error in detecting predictive genetic alterations on tumor tissue and can be overcome by testing alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using liquid biopsy. We assessed 72 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) using Idylla  Biocartis, a fully automated platform that evaluates the most frequent mutations of KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genes. We correlated the results of liquid biopsy and standard tissue-based next generation sequencing (NGS) analyses to patient clinical features. The overall agreement was 81.94%. Concordance was 85.71% and 96.15% in treatment-naive patients and in the patient subgroup with liver metastases, respectively. In liver metastases positive, treatment-naive patients, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) were 92.31%, 100% and 100%, respectively. Circulating mutational fraction (CMF) was significantly higher in patients with liver metastases and high carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. In a subgroup of patients pre-treated with anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) agents, emerging KRAS mutations were evidenced in 33% of cases. Testing RAS/BRAF mutations on plasma using the Idylla  Biocartis platform is feasible and reliable in mCRC patients in clinical practice.|Cancer
ID:31597840|Title:The differential diagnosis of classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN): the updated WHO criteria.Abstract:The classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), are characterized by clonal myeloproliferation without features of myelodysplasia. The diagnostic approach proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) uses clinical features, peripheral blood counts and smear analysis, bone marrow (BM) morphology, karyotype and molecular genetic tests to classify MPN subtypes. The detection of characteristic driver mutations like JAK2V617F, JAK2 exon 12, MPL, and calrecticulin (CALR) is a major diagnostic feature. JAK2 mutations are detected in more than 90% of patients with PV and are therefore used as highly sensitive clonal marker in this subtype. However, JAK2 mutations may also occur in ET and PMF, while CALR is virtually not seen in PV. Therefore, BM remains the central diagnostic platform and is essential for distinguishing ET from pre-fibrotic PMF and diagnosing cases which do not express JAK2, MPL or CALR ('wild-type' or 'triple-negative' MPN). The standardization of relevant BM features is mandatory to recognize characteristic and easy to assess patterns that enable an accurate discrimination between the MPN subtypes. Key parameters include cellularity, erythropoiesis and neutrophil granulopoiesis in context with specific features of megakaryocytes as well as the BM fiber content, especially in early stage MPN that present with thrombocytosis and clinically mimic essential thrombocythemia.|Cancer

Despite clinical need, few pharmacogenomics studies in pRCC have been performed. Moreover, current research fails to adequately include pRCC laboratory models, such as the ACHN or Caki-2 pRCC cell lines. The molecular mechanisms involved in pRCC development and drug resistance are more diverse than in clear-cell RCC, in which inactivation of VHL occurs in the majority of tumours. Drug resistance to multiple therapies in pRCC occurs via genetic alteration (such as mutations resulting in abnormal receptor tyrosine kinase activation or RALBP1 inhibition), dysregulation of signalling pathways (such as GSK3beta-EIF4EBP1, PI3K-AKT and the MAPK or interleukin signalling pathways), deregulation of cellular processes (such as resistance to apoptosis or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition) and interactions between the cell and its environment (for example, through activation of matrix metalloproteinases). Improved understanding of resistance mechanisms will facilitate drug discovery and provide new effective therapies. Further studies on novel resistance biomarkers are needed to improve patient prognosis and stratification as well as drug development.|Cancer
ID:31602213|Title:Detection of ctDNA in the plasma of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.Abstract:A total of 15-30% of thyroid nodules that are evaluated by fine-needle aspiration are not clearly determined to be benign or malignant. Gene mutation analysis is recommended for the evaluation of thyroid nodules using clinical guidelines. The detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has the potential to aid in the screening, diagnosis and prediction of thyroid cancer prognosis, and can be used when tissues are difficult to obtain. In the present study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on tumors and matched normal tissues from 10 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in Quanzhou, China. Hotspot mutations in tumor DNA and cell-free DNA were identified in the validation cohort, which included 59 patients with PTC. BRAF V600E occurred in five samples, and was the most frequent mutation observed. Variation allele frequency (VAF) of BRAF V600E detected by WES was positively correlated with VAF determined using digital PCR (R2=0.9197; P=0.0099). A number of novel mutated genes were identified, including zinc finger protein 717, pleckstrin homology like domain family A member 1, RBMX like 3, lysine methyltransferase 5A and trichohyalin, along with the reported genes BRAF, NRAS and mucin 16, cell surface associated. Somatic mutated genes were enriched in the 'focal adhesion' pathway, as determined by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes or Gene Ontology analysis. In the validation cohort, 44.07% of tumors were BRAF V600E-positive, and the sensitivity and specificity of BRAF V600E ctDNA were 61.54 and 90.91%, respectively. BRAF V600E was associated with aggressive tumor factors, including lymph node metastasis (P=0.001) and advanced disease stage (P=0.009). The present study investigated the accuracy of ctDNA detection in patients with PTC, and provided evidence that ctDNA can be used as an evaluation of tumor DNA in thyroid nodules.|Cancer
ID:31602373|Title:Detection of Novel Fusion Transcript VTI1A-CFAP46 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is now the second-highest cause of cancer death worldwide. Recent studies have discovered a wide range of somatic mutations in HCC. These mutations involve various vital signaling pathways such as: Wnt/beta-Catenin, p53, telome-rase reverse transcriptase (TERT), chromatin remodeling, RAS/MAPK signaling, and oxidative stress. However, fusion transcripts have not been broadly explored in HCC. METHODS: To identify novel fusion transcripts in HCC, in the first phase of our study, we performed targeted RNA sequencing (in HCC and paired non-HCC tissues) on 6 patients with a diagnosis of HCC undergoing liver transplantation. RESULTS: As a result of these studies, we discovered the novel fusion transcript, VTI1A-CFAP46. In the second phase of our study, we measured the expression of wild-type VTI1A in 21 HCC specimens, which showed that 10 of 21 exhibited upregulation of wild-type VTI1A in their tumors. VTI1A (Vesicle Transport via Interaction with t-SNARE homolog 1A) is a member of the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) gene family, which is essential for membrane trafficking and function in endocytosis, autophagy, and Golgi transport. Notably, it is known that autophagy is involved in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: The link between novel fusion transcript VTI1A-CFAP46 and autophagy as a potential therapeutic target in HCC patients deserves further investigation. Moreover, this study shows that fusion transcripts are worthy of additional exploration in HCC.|Cancer

Whereas for many years RAS mutations were the only relevant molecular alterations examined in mCRC, nowadays the BRAF, HER2, and microsatellite instability status of a given tumor is gaining importance, since it has not only prognostic relevance but opens new avenues for therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes the recent advances in molecular approaches to mCRC and their therapeutic consequences and discusses novel approaches for molecular diagnostics in mCRC.|Cancer
ID:31606421|Title:CTNNB1 and APC mutations in odontogenic carcinoma with dentinoid.Abstract:The purpose of the present study is to report 2 cases of odontogenic carcinoma with dentinoid, a rare low-grade odontogenic carcinoma associated with facial deformity and bone loss, and to investigate the presence of pathogenic mutations in these samples. By using a next-generation sequencing approach, we sequenced a panel of 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes commonly mutated in human cancer. Microscopic features of both cases revealed solid areas of malignant odontogenic tumor with a large amount of dentinoid material. We identified pathogenic mutations in the genes CTNNB1 and APC, both of which are part of the Wnt-signaling pathway. Consistent with Wnt-signaling activation, both tumors showed strong beta-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei. The molecular profile of odontogenic carcinoma with dentinoid may help in its diagnosis, as well as in the identification of potential molecular targets for therapy in the future.|Cancer
ID:31608732|Title:Liquid biopsy tracking of lung tumor evolutions over time.Abstract:Introduction: The rise of the personalized era in lung cancer prompted the evaluation of novel diagnostic tools to overcome some of the limits of traditional tumor genotyping. Liquid biopsy refers to a multitude of minimally invasive techniques that can allow a real-time biomolecular characterization of the tumor through the analysis of human body fluids.Areas covered: Herein we provide a comprehensive overview of the role of liquid biopsy in lung cancer, mainly focusing on the most studied members of the liquid biopsy family, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs).Expert opinion: Among the different components of the large liquid biopsy family, cfDNA is the most studied and widely adopted source for tumor genotyping in lung cancer, already entered clinical practice for detection of both sensitizing and resistance EGFR mutations. However, the impressive technological advances made in the last few years are expanding its potential applications, allowing a more comprehensive plasma genotyping through next-generation sequencing and moving from advanced/metastatic disease to novel frontiers, such as early detection and minimal residual disease evaluation.|Cancer
ID:31612916|Title:Dramatic response of FOLFIRINOX regimen in a collision pancreatic adenocarcinoma patient with a germline BRCA2 mutation: a case report.Abstract:Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are the most common gene mutations in familial pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Several reports have demonstrated the utility of platinum-based chemotherapy for treating cancer patients who harbour a BRCA mutation. Here we discuss a 47-year-old Japanese female with no relevant past history who presented with epigastralgia and fever in September 2016. A computed tomography scan revealed a low-density, low-enhanced tumour 15 mm in diameter in the head of the pancreas. The pathological diagnosis was a ductal pancreatic carcinoma. A 6 mm low-enhanced metastatic tumour was also detected in segment 4 of the liver. Because she had early onset of the disease and a family history-her mother died of pancreatic adenocarcinoma at age 48-we considered a diagnosis of familial pancreatic adenocarcinoma. She received modified FOLFIRINOX. Two months after starting chemotherapy, she was diagnosed with an invasive ductal carcinoma in the right breast. FOLFIRINOX was continued for 8 cycles (4 months); the primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma shrank and the liver metastatic foci disappeared, but the size of the breast tumour increased. Total right breast excision and sentinel lymph node dissection were performed. FOLFIRINOX was continued and after 12 cycles (6 months), both her pancreatic adenocarcinoma and liver metastasis were no longer visible using imaging. Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed and the primary tumour had shrunk to 2.5 mm. Genetic testing revealed a germline BRCA2 mutation. The FOLFIRINOX regimen showed dramatic effects on the collision pancreatic but not on the breast cancer.|Cancer
ID:31622660|Title:Genomics of gynaecological carcinosarcomas and future treatment options.Abstract:Gynaecological carcinosarcomas are the most lethal gynaecological malignancies that are often highly resistant to standard chemotherapy. They are composed of both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components and are associated with high rates of metastatic disease. Due to their rarity, molecular studies have been carried out on relatively few tumours, revealing a broad spectrum of heterogeneity. In this review, we have collated the gene mutations, gene expression, epigenetic regulation and protein expression reported by a number of studies on gynaecological carcinosarcomas. Based on these results, we describe potential therapeutics that may demonstrate efficacy and present any pre-clinical studies that have been carried out. We also describe the pre-clinical models currently available for future research to assess the potential of molecularly matched therapies. Interestingly, over-expression of many biomarkers in carcinosarcoma tumours often doesn't correlate with a worse prognosis. Therefore, we propose that profiling the mutational landscape, gene expression, and gene amplification/deletion may better indicate potential treatment strategies and predict response, thus improving outcomes for women with this rare, aggressive disease.|Cancer
ID:31623866|Title:The role of exosomes and MYC in therapy resistance of acute myeloid leukemia: Challenges and opportunities.Abstract:Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is caused by abnormal production of white blood cells, red blood cells or platelets. The leukemia cells communicate with their microenvironment through nano-vesicle exosomes that are 30-100 nm in diameter. These nano-vesicles are released from body fluids upon fusion of an endocytic compartment with the cell membrane. Exosomes function as cargo to deliver signaling molecules to distant cells. This allows cross-talk between hematopoietic cells and other distant target cell environments. Exosomes support leukemia growth by acting as messengers between tumor cells and the microenvironment as well as inducing oncogenic factors such as c-Myc. Exosomes have also been used as biomarkers in the clinical diagnosis of leukemia. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are two crucial signaling molecules involved in the AML pathogenesis and MYC stability. GSK-3 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that coordinates with over 40 different proteins during physiological/pathological conditions in blood cells. The dysregulation in GSK-3 has been reported during hematological malignancies. GSK-3 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting c-MYC, MCL-1 and beta-catenin. Conversely, GSK-3 can also act as tumor promoter in some instances. The pharmacological modulators of GSK-3 such as ABT-869, 6-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO), GS-87 and LY2090314 have shown promise in the treatment of hematological malignancy. PP2A is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of hematological malignancy. PP2A-activating drugs (PADs) can effectively antagonize leukemogenesis. The discovery of exosomes, kinase inhibitors and phosphatase activators have provided new hope to the leukemia patients. This review discusses the role of exosomes, GSK-3 and PP2A in the pathogenesis of leukemia. We provide evidence from both preclinical and clinical studies.|Cancer
ID:31631483|Title:A first Japanese case of neuroendocrine prostate cancer accompanied by lung and brain metastasis with somatic and germline BRCA2 mutation.Abstract:Germline mutations and copy number changes in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes such as BRCA2 are associated with aggressive forms of prostate cancer (PCa). Although the prevalence of BRCA2 variants in PCa is increasing in Japan, the genomic and biological implications in Japanese patients are unclear. An 81-year-old male presented with prostatic adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation accompanied by metastatic lung nodule and brain metastases. Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy combined with etoposide resulted in partial and complete remissions of brain and lung metastases, respectively. Next-generation sequencing of biopsy and peripheral blood samples demonstrated a somatic BRCA2 mutation at c.7008-2A>C and a germline mutation at p.E2877*. The patient's son had been diagnosed with breast cancer 2.5 years ago and was found to have the same germline BRCA2 mutation. BRCA2 mutation increases the risks of aggressive PCa and other cancer types in Japanese males. These forms may be highly responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy.|Cancer

Renal MFH is rare and information about its molecular characterization is limited. We present here the case of a 77-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a huge right renal mass on computed tomography. Radical nephrectomy was performed. Pathological diagnosis was MFH arising from the renal capsule. We used Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel version 2 primers to perform gene mutation screening. We detected 13 mutations in 11 hotspot oncogenes (CSF1R, FGFR3, KDR, APC, PDGFRA, TP53, FLT3, ERBB4, KIT, STK11, RET), but these were not matched to driver mutations.|Cancer
ID:31641659|Title:Intraoral EBV-positive sporadic Burkitt lymphoma in an elderly patient with bilateral presentation.Abstract:Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (SBL) is a variant of Burkitt lymphoma that occurs worldwide, affecting mainly children and young adults. Association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can be identified in approximately 20-30% of cases. Herein we described a case of a 63-year-old male presenting intraoral bilateral mandibular swelling, subjacent to fixed dental prosthesis, with one month of duration. Incisional biopsies were performed, and after two days, the patient was hospitalized due to malaise and breathing difficulty, and died after a week when an abdominal tumor was detected. The mandibular biopsies revealed a diffuse proliferation of medium-sized monomorphic atypical lymphoid cells exhibiting numerous mitoses and areas of "starry-sky" pattern. The tumor showed immunohistochemical positivity for CD20, CD10, Bcl-6, and Ki-67 (  100%); it was negative for CD3, Bcl-2, Vs38c, and MUM-1. Positivity for EBV was found by in situ hybridization. The final diagnosis was intraoral SBL positive for EBV. Clinical, morphological and molecular criteria are necessary for the correct diagnosis of aggressive B-cell neoplasms positive for EBV in elderly patients.|Cancer
ID:31647020|Title:A rare simultaneous coexistence of epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumors and schwannoma in the stomach: a case report.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), a type of mesenchymal tumor in the gastrointestinal tract, are believed to be closely associated with PDGFRA and C-KIT mutations. Schwannoma in the stomach, which is an unusual location, is a rare disorder. The simultaneous occurrence of the two diseases is rarer than metachronous occurrences, and its pathological characteristics have not been reported to date. We present a case report on a patient with simultaneous coexistence of gastric schwannoma and GISTs. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old female visited our hospital complaining of intermittent abdominal pain for the previous 3 months. CT revealed a 3.4 cm slight homogeneous enhancement in the lesser curvature of the stomach; the mass was nodular soft tissue, which was removed by radical surgery. Two solid tumors with different volumes were located in the stomach. Histologically and immunohistochemically different, the larger tumor consisted of spindle cells surrounded by a peripheral lymphoid cuff, and was positive for S-100. The larger tumor was therefore classified as a gastric schwannoma. The smaller tumor was composed of medium-sized round, oval cells with amphiphilic granular cytoplasm; vacuolization was also observed. The tumor cells were positive for DOG1 and sporadically positive for CD34 and CD117. Hence, the smaller tumor was diagnosed as epithelioid GISTs. Sanger sequencing revealed that the GIST tumor cells contained a deletion mutation (c.2527_2538 del12,843-846del4), which was located in exon 18 of PDGFRA. CONCLUSION: GISTs combined with gastric schwannoma are a considerably rare subgroup of gastric tumors. Related clinical research is comparatively weak, and the mechanism remains unknown. We reviewed related articles to provide knowledge to improve the correct identification, diagnosis and management of patients with gastric cancer. All pathologists involved in the diagnosis and clinicians involved in the treatment should be aware of this new kind of disease pattern to improve their understanding of the disease.|Cancer
ID:31650704|Title:Comparative aspects of mast cell neoplasia in animals and the role of KIT in prognosis and treatment.Abstract:Mast cell neoplasia clinical presentation and biological behaviour vary considerably across mammalian species, ranging from a solitary benign mass to an aggressive systemic malignancy. Mutations in the KIT Proto-Oncogene Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (KIT) gene are common molecular abnormalities involved in mast cell tumorigenesis. KIT mutations often occur in dog, cat and human neoplastic mast cells and result in altered Kit protein structure and function. In dogs, certain KIT mutations are associated with more malignant and lethal disease. In contrast, KIT mutations in feline and human mast cell neoplasms are not correlated with prognosis, but are of value in diagnosis and treatment planning in humans. KIT genetic abnormalities have not been well investigated in other species, although aberrant cytoplasmic Kit protein staining detected in neoplasms of the ferret, horse and cow resembles aberrant Kit staining patterns detected in neoplastic mast cells of dogs, cats and humans. Mutations within KIT are classified as either regulatory-type or enzymatic pocket-type mutations according to their location within the KIT Proto-Oncogene. Mutations within the enzymatic pocket domain confer tumour resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, knowledge of tumour KIT mutation status adds valuable information for optimizing patient treatment strategies. The use of TKIs in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics has opened a new treatment avenue for patients unresponsive to existing drugs. This review highlights the similarities and differences of mast cell neoplasia in mammals with a special focus on the involvement of KIT in the canine and feline forms in comparison to human mast cell neoplasia.|Cancer
ID:31653094|Title:Tumor BRCA Test for Patients with Epithelial Ovarian Cancer: The Role of Molecular Pathology in the Era of PARP Inhibitor Therapy.Abstract:The PARP inhibitor olaparib has been approved in the maintenance setting of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer patients with germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutation. Therefore, the availability of a tumor BRCA test has become a clinical need. We report the results of the clinical implementation of a tumor BRCA test within the frame of an institutional workflow for the management of patients with nonmucinous and nonborderline epithelial ovarian cancer. In total, 223 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer were prospectively analyzed. BRCA1/2 status was evaluated on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens using next-generation sequencing technology. The tumor BRCA test had a success rate of 99.1% (221 of 223 successfully analyzed cases) and a median turnaround time of 17 calendar days. Among the 221 cases, BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations were found in 62 (28.1%) cases and variants of uncertain significance in 25 (11.3%) cases. The concordance rate between tumor BRCA test results and germline BRCA1/2 status was 87%, with five cases harboring pathogenic/likely pathogenic somatic-only mutations. The next-generation, sequencing-based tumor BRCA test showed a high success rate and a turnaround time compatible with clinical purposes. The tumor BRCA test could be implemented in a molecular diagnostic setting and it may guide the clinical management of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.|Cancer
ID:31655381|Title:2D magnetic MoS2-Fe3O4 hybrid nanostructures for ultrasensitive exosome detection in GMR sensor.Abstract:Exosome released from cells plays an important role in intercellular communication and show great clinical potential in early cancer screening and prognosis. Herein, an ultrasensitive Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) biosensor was developed for exosome detection, which was based on 2D MoS2-Fe3O4 nanostructures (MOFE) as magnetic responsive probes for signal amplification. The MOFE can be readily synthesized with simple phase transfer method. Compared to pure Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), the layered MoS2 function as a template for recruiting high loading density of MNPs as magnetic probes. After modified by aptamer, we discover that the 2D magnetic MOFE hybrid nanostructures enable both multidentate targeting and multi-magnetic particle-based signal amplification, increasing the magnetic sensor performance, especially in sensitivity and output signal. Moreover, the 2D magnetic nanocomposites afford high selectivity and excellent reproducibility with detection limit of 100 exosomes in GMR sensor. Results demonstrate that the magnetic strategy based on 2D structures introduced here provide a new dimension for exosome detection, which show great potential of engineering 2D magnetic nanobioprobes for GMR based liquid biopsy application.|Cancer
ID:31679010|Title:Fine-Needle Aspiration Features of BCOR-CCNB3 Sarcoma.Abstract:OBJECTIVES: BCOR-CCNB3 sarcoma (BCS) is an undifferentiated tumor that has some clinical and morphologic similarity to classic Ewing sarcoma, but it is characterized by a distinct BCOR-CCNB3 gene fusion. There are no reports describing its cytomorphologic findings. METHODS: We describe cytologic findings of five molecularly proven BCS cases (four males and one female, aged 8.5-22 years). RESULTS: Smears showed mainly round cells, but some spindle cells and rhabdoid-like cells were also observed. Dispersed cells dominated in smears, but also distinct pseudopapillary structures with vascular cores were noted in four cases. Scant connective tissue fragments were found in four cases. There was no rosette formation in any case. CONCLUSIONS: BCS should be differentiated from other round cell tumors. Some cytologic features, especially rhabdoid-like cells, connective tissue fragments, and pseudopapillary formations, combined with immunohistochemical and molecular studies, may be helpful in making the appropriate diagnosis.|Cancer
ID:31681586|Title:Long Non-coding RNAs in Myeloid Malignancies.Abstract:Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents 80% of adult leukemias and 15-20% of childhood leukemias. AML are characterized by the presence of 20% blasts or more in the bone marrow, or defining cytogenetic abnormalities. Laboratory diagnoses of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) depend on morphological changes based on dysplasia in peripheral blood and bone marrow, including peripheral blood smears, bone marrow aspirate smears, and bone marrow biopsies. As leukemic cells are not functional, the patient develops anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, leading to fatigue, recurrent infections, and hemorrhage. The genetic background and associated mutations in AML blasts determine the clinical course of the disease. Over the last decade, non-coding RNAs transcripts that do not codify for proteins but play a role in regulation of functions have been shown to have multiple applications in the diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic approach of various types of cancers, including myeloid malignancies. After a comprehensive review of current literature, we found reports of multiple long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can differentiate between AML types and how their exogenous modulation can dramatically change the behavior of AML cells. These lncRNAs include: H19, LINC00877, RP11-84C10, CRINDE, RP11848P1.3, ZNF667-AS1, AC111000.4-202, SFMBT2, LINC02082-201, MEG3, AC009495.2, PVT1, HOTTIP, SNHG5, and CCAT1. In addition, by performing an analysis on available AML data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we found 10 lncRNAs with significantly differential expression between patients in favorable, intermediate/normal, or poor cytogenetic risk categories. These are: DANCR, PRDM16-DT, SNHG6, OIP5-AS1, SNHG16, JPX, FTX, KCNQ1OT1, TP73-AS1, and GAS5. The identification of a molecular signature based on lncRNAs has the potential for have deep clinical significance, as it could potentially help better define the evolution from low-grade MDS to high-grade MDS to AML, changing the course of therapy. This would allow clinicians to provide a more personalized, patient-tailored therapeutic approach, moving from transfusion-based therapy, as is the case for low-grade MDS, to the introduction of azacytidine-based chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which is the current treatment for high-grade MDS.|Cancer
ID:31681608|Title:Epigenetic Targets in Synovial Sarcoma: A Mini-Review.Abstract:Synovial Sarcomas (SS) are a type of Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) and represent 8-10% of all STS cases. Although SS can arise at any age, it typically affects younger individuals aged 15-35 and is therefore part of both pediatric and adult clinical practices. SS occurs primarily in the limbs, often near joints, but can present anywhere. It is characterized by the recurrent pathognomonic chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) that most frequently fuses SSX1 or SSX2 genes with SS18. This leads to the expression of the SS18-SSX fusion protein, which causes disturbances in several interacting multiprotein complexes such as the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex, also known as the BAF complex and the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). Furthermore, this promotes widespread epigenetic rewiring, leading to aberrant gene expression that drives the pathogenesis of SS. Good prognoses are characterized predominantly by small tumor size and young patient age. Whereas, high tumor grade and an increased genomic complexity of the tumor constitute poor prognostic factors. The current therapeutic strategy relies on chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the latter of which can lead to chronic side effects for pediatric patients. We will focus on the known roles of SWI/SNF, PRC1, and PRC2 as the main effectors of the SS18-SSX-mediated genome modifications and we present existing biological rationale for potential therapeutic targets and treatment strategies.|Cancer

Patients who previously participated in two phase IV trials (TNT and IDEAL) with genetic data were used (n<sub>pooled</sub> = 11,196). A GWAS meta-analysis using Cox modeling for the prediction of incident cancer was conducted in the pooled cohort and sex-stratified. rs13210472 (near HLA-DOA gene) was associated with higher risk of incident cancer amongst women with prevalent coronary artery disease (CAD) taking statins (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.66, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.88-3.76, P = 3.5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Using the UK Biobank and focusing exclusively on women statin users with CAD (n<sub>female </sub>= 2952), rs13210472 remained significantly associated with incident cancer (HR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.14-2.56, P = 9.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup>). The association was not observed in non-statin users. In this genetic meta-analysis, we have identified a variant in women statin users with prevalent CAD that was associated with incident cancer, possibly implicating the human leukocyte antigen pathway.|Cancer

ID:36066851|Title:EPIK-O/ENGOT-OV61: alpelisib plus olaparib vs cytotoxic chemotherapy in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (phase III study).Abstract:Patients with platinum-resistant or -refractory high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) have a poor prognosis, and their management represents a substantial unmet medical need. Preclinical data and results from a phase Ib trial demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of the α-specific phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor alpelisib plus the poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib in platinum-resistant, non-<i>BRCA</i>-mutated ovarian cancer. Here, we describe the study design and rationale for the phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controlled EPIK-O/ENGOT-OV61 trial investigating alpelisib in combination with olaparib compared with standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant or -refractory HGSOC with no germline <i>BRCA</i> mutation. Progression-free survival (blinded independent review committee) is the primary end point. Overall survival is a key secondary end point. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b>: NCT04729387 (ClinicalTrials.gov).|Cancer
ID:36169546|Title:Hepatocellular Adenoma Subtypes Based on 2017 Classification System: Exploratory Study of Gadoxetate Disodium-Enhanced MRI Features With Proposal of a Diagnostic Algorithm.Abstract:<b>BACKGROUND.</b> The classification of hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) was updated in 2017 on the basis of genetic and molecular analysis. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this article was to evaluate features on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI of HCA subtypes on the basis of the 2017 classification and to propose a diagnostic algorithm for determining subtype using these features. <b>METHODS.</b> This retrospective study included 56 patients (49 women, seven men; mean age, 37 ± 13 [SD] years) with histologically confirmed HCA evaluated by gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI from January 2010 to January 2021. Subtypes were reclassified using 2017 criteria: hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α mutated HCA (HHCA), inflammatory HCA (IHCA), β-catenin exon 3 activated HCA (β-HCA), mixed inflammatory and β-HCA (β-IHCA), sonic hedgehog HCA (shHCA), and unclassified HCA (UHCA). Qualitative MRI features were assessed. Liver-to-lesion contrast enhancement ratios (LLCERs) were measured. Subtypes were compared, and a diagnostic algorithm was proposed. <b>RESULTS.</b> The analysis included 65 HCAs: 16 HHCAs, 31 IHCAs, six β-HCA, four β-IHCA, five shHCA, and three UHCAs. HHCAs showed homogeneous diffuse intralesional steatosis in 94%, whereas all other HCAs showed this finding in 0% (<i>p</i> < .001). IHCAs showed the "atoll" sign in 58%, whereas all other HCAs showed this finding in 12% (<i>p</i> < .001). IHCAs showed moderate T2 hyperintensity in 52%, whereas all other HCAs showed this finding in 12% (<i>p</i> < .001). The β-HCAs and β-IHCAs occurred in men in 63%, whereas all other HCAs occurred in men in 4% (<i>p</i> < .001). The β-HCAs and β-IHCAs had a mean size of 10.1 ± 6.8 cm, whereas all other HCAs had a mean size of 5.1 ± 2.9 cm (<i>p</i> = .03). The β-HCAs and β-IHCAs showed fluid components in 60%, whereas all other HCAs showed this finding in 5% (<i>p</i> < .001). Hepatobiliary phase iso- or hyperintensity was observed in 80% of β-HCAs and β-IHCAs versus 5% of all other HCAs (<i>p</i> < .001). Hepatobiliary phase LLCER was positive in nine HCAs (eight β-HCAs and β-IHCAs; one IHCA). The shHCA and UHCA did not show distinguishing features. The proposed diagnostic algorithm had accuracy of 98% for HHCAs, 83% for IHCAs, and 95% for β-HCAs or β-IHCAs. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Findings on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI, including hepatobiliary phase characteristics, were associated with HCA subtypes using the 2017 classification. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> The algorithm identified common HCA subtypes with high accuracy, including those with β-catenin exon 3 mutations.|Cancer

ID:36356599|Title:Non-viral precision T cell receptor replacement for personalized cell therapy.Abstract:T cell receptors (TCRs) enable T cells to specifically recognize mutations in cancer cells<sup>1-3</sup>. Here we developed a clinical-grade approach based on CRISPR-Cas9 non-viral precision genome-editing to simultaneously knockout the two endogenous TCR genes TRAC (which encodes TCRα) and TRBC (which encodes TCRβ). We also inserted into the TRAC locus two chains of a neoantigen-specific TCR (neoTCR) isolated from circulating T cells of patients. The neoTCRs were isolated using a personalized library of soluble predicted neoantigen-HLA capture reagents. Sixteen patients with different refractory solid cancers received up to three distinct neoTCR transgenic cell products. Each product expressed a patient-specific neoTCR and was administered in a cell-dose-escalation, first-in-human phase I clinical trial ( NCT03970382 ). One patient had grade 1 cytokine release syndrome and one patient had grade 3 encephalitis. All participants had the expected side effects from the lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Five patients had stable disease and the other eleven had disease progression as the best response on the therapy. neoTCR transgenic T cells were detected in tumour biopsy samples after infusion at frequencies higher than the native TCRs before infusion. This study demonstrates the feasibility of isolating and cloning multiple TCRs that recognize mutational neoantigens. Moreover, simultaneous knockout of the endogenous TCR and knock-in of neoTCRs using single-step, non-viral precision genome-editing are achieved. The manufacture of neoTCR engineered T cells at clinical grade, the safety of infusing up to three gene-edited neoTCR T cell products and the ability of the transgenic T cells to traffic to the tumours of patients are also demonstrated.|Cancer

ID:36606708|Title:Sequence analyses of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas unravel three genetic subgroups of patients and the GNA13 mutant as poor prognostic biomarker, results of LNH-EP1 study.Abstract:Advances in molecular profiling of newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have recently refine genetic subgroups. Genetic subgroups remain undetermined at the time of relapse or refractory (RR) disease. This study aims to decipher genetic subgroups and search for prognostic molecular biomarkers in patients with RR-DLBCL. From 2015 to 2021, targeted next-generation sequencing analyses of germline-matched tumor samples and fresh tissue from RR-DLBCL patients were performed. Unsupervised clustering of somatic mutations was performed and correlations with patient outcome were sought. A number of 120 patients with RR-DLBCL were included in LNH-EP1 study and a molecular tumor landscape was successfully analyzed in 87% of patients (104/120 tumor samples). The median age was 67.5 years (range 27.4-87.4), median number of previous treatments was 2 (range 1-9). The most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (n = 53 mutations; 42% of samples), CREBBP (n = 39; 32%), BCL2 (n = 86; 31%), KMT2D (n = 39; 28%) and PIM1 (n = 54; 22%). Unsupervised clustering separated three genetic subgroups entitled BST (enriched in BCL2, SOCS1, and TNFRSF14 mutations); TKS (enriched in TP53, KMT2D, and STAT6 mutations); and PCM (enriched in PIM1, CD79B, and MYD88 mutations). Median overall survival (OS) was 11.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.1-12.6) months. OS was not significantly different between the three genetic subgroups. GNA13 mutant was significantly associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio: 6.6 [95% CI: 2.1-20.6]; p = .0011) and shorter OS (p = .0340). At the time of relapse or refractory disease, three genetic subgroups of DLBCL patients were delineated, which could help advance precision molecular medicine programs.|Cancer

ID:36610490|Title:Phase I Study: Safety and Efficacy of an Ex Vivo-Expanded Allogeneic Natural Killer Cell (MG4101) with Rituximab for Relapsed/Refractory B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.Abstract:The prognosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) remains poor, with an unmet need for novel therapies. MG4101, an ex vivo-expanded allogeneic natural killer (NK) cell, can enhance rituximab antibody-dependent cytotoxicity in relapsed/refractory (r/r) B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of MG4101 plus rituximab for patients with r/r NHL. Patients received escalating doses of i.v. MG4101 plus rituximab every 2 weeks. IL-2 was administered s.c. after MG4101 treatment. Fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide was administered i.v. before rituximab treatment in cycles 1, 3, and 5. A 3+3 design was used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and maximum feasible dose. Assessments were performed over a 6-cycle period, with an extended maintenance period of up to 8 cycles. Nine patients received 3 different doses of MG4101 and rituximab. MTD could not be determined because of the absence of dose-limiting toxicity. Treatment-related adverse events, mostly grade 1 or 2, occurred in 89% of patients. Only 1 patient experienced grade 1 cytokine release syndrome. MG4101 persisted for at least 7 days in 7 patients. Four patients achieved a partial response and 1 patient attained a complete response, for an overall response rate of 55.6%. Two patients showed prolonged responses and low exhaustion marker levels in T cells. For allogeneic NK cell therapy, strategies including the use of the high-affinity hFcγRIIIaV158 variant of the KIR B/x haplotype with lymphodepleting chemotherapy may be promising options for improving clinical efficacy in the antibody combination therapeutic setting as an off-the-shelf product. MG4101 plus rituximab presented a favorable safety profile and overall response rate in patients with r/r NHL.|Cancer
ID:36621911|Title:Diagnosis and management of parathyroid carcinoma: a state-of-the-art review.Abstract:Parathyroid carcinoma is one of the least common endocrine malignancies and accounts for approximately 1% of all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature published between January 2000 and March 2022 via Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EudraCT, ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL and SCOPUS was conducted. Manuscripts were eligible if they included data on adult non-pregnant populations with parathyroid carcinoma. No restrictions regarding interventions, comparators or duration of follow-up were imposed. Single case reports, reviews or meta-analyses were excluded. Outcomes of interest were molecular pathogenesis, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and overall survival. Study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. This review included 75 studies from 17 countries, reporting on more than 3000 patients with parathyroid carcinoma. CDC73 mutation has been recognised as playing a pivotal role in molecular pathogenesis. Parathyroid carcinoma typically presents with markedly increased calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The most frequently described symptoms were bone and muscle pain or weakness. En bloc resection remains the gold standard for the surgical approach. The 5-year overall survival ranged from 60 to 93%, with resistant hypercalcaemia a significant cause of mortality. Emerging evidence indicating that targeted therapy, based on molecular biomarkers, presents a novel treatment option. The rarity of PC and need for personalised treatment warrant multidisciplinary management in a 'centre of excellence' with a track record in PC management.|Cancer
ID:36621979|Title:Loss of CBX2 causes genomic instability and Wnt activation in high grade serous ovarian carcinoma cells.Abstract:High grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is lethal with insidious onset, rapid progression, poor prognosis, and limited treatment options. Polycomb repressor complexes (PRC) 1 and 2 are intimately involved in progression of many types of cancer including HGSOC. Unlike the consistent constitution of PRC2, PRC1 consists of diverse components whose clinical significance in HGSOC are not entirely clear. Here, prognosis-associated PRC1 components were identified through data-mining. CBX2 promoted proliferation and reduced apoptosis of HGSOC cell lines OVCAR4, OVCAR3, and CAOV3. Complete loss of CBX2 by CRISPR-cas9 editing (CBX2<sup>KO</sup> ) destabilized genome stability with increased spontaneous chromosomal breaks and tendency to polyploidy accompanied by disrupted cell cycle especially stalled G2/M transition and caused severe cell death. Wnt/β-catenin/LEF1/TCF7L1 was activated in surviving OVCAR4-CBX2<sup>KO</sup> clones to bypass the crisis caused by loss of CBX2. The relieve of TCF7L1 core-promoter region occupied by CBX2 might be one of the possible explanations to TCF7L1 increase in OVCAR4-CBX2<sup>KO</sup> clones. Subcutaneous tumor model further validated that depletion of CBX2 repressed HGSOC cell line derived tumor growth. High immunohistochemistry score of CBX2 in primary ovarian cancer tissue associated with advanced clinical stage (p = 0.033), poor overall survival (HR = 3.056, 95% CI: 1.024-9.123), and progression free survival (HR = 4.455, 95% CI: 1.513-13.118) in HGSOC. Overall, our results suggested that CBX2 was a promising prognostic factor and therapeutic target in HGSOC.|Cancer

ID:36708875|Title:P300 Interacted With N-Myc and Regulated Its Protein Stability via Altering Its Post-Translational Modifications in Neuroblastoma.Abstract:MYCN amplification is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in neuroblastoma (NB), but its protein product cannot be directly targeted because of protein structure. Thus, this study aimed to explore novel ways to indirectly target N-Myc by regulating its post-translational modifications (PTMs) and therefore protein stability. N-Myc coimmunoprecipitation combined with HPLC-MS/MS identified 16 PTM residues and 114 potential N-Myc-interacting proteins. Notably, both acetylation and ubiquitination were identified on lysine 199 of N-Myc. We then discovered that p300, which can interact with N-Myc, modulated the protein stability of N-Myc in MYCN-amplified NB cell lines and simultaneously regulated the acetylation level and ubiquitination level on lysine-199 of N-Myc protein in vitro. Furthermore, p300 correlated with poor prognosis in NB patients. Taken together, p300 can be considered as a potential therapeutic target to treat MYCN-amplified NB patients, and other identified PTMs and interacting proteins also provide potential targets for further study.|Cancer
ID:36719787|Title:Intratumor Injection of Thermosensitive Polypeptide with Resveratrol Inhibits Glioblastoma Growth.Abstract:Local tumor treatment is a feasible measure for patients with glioblastoma (GBM) who are unsuitable for surgical resection. Interferon-elastin-like polypeptide [IFN-ELP(V)] is a slow-release, biodegradable, thermosensitive fusion protein with antitumor immunity, and resveratrol (Res) is a polyphenolic compound with an antitumor effect. In this study, we found that intratumor injection of IFN-ELP(V) combined with intraperitoneal injection of Res is more effective in delaying GBM growth in mice. Specifically, in an orthotopic GBM model, we found a significant improvement in the median survival with this strategy. Our results suggested that the combined use of IFN-ELP(V) and Res has a dramatic synergistic effect on GBM, thus providing a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for tumors. Impact statement We report a novel and effective strategy in which the combined use of interferon-elastin-like polypeptide [IFN-ELP(V)] and Res effectively inhibits glioblastoma growth. IFN-ELP(V) can create a reservoir in the tumor and continuously release IFN to produce a powerful <i>in situ</i> antitumor immune response; furthermore, the combination of IFN-ELP(V) and Res is more effective in inhibiting tumor growth.|Cancer

ID:36736685|Title:Amplicon-based NGS test for assessing MLH1 promoter methylation and its correlation with BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer patients.Abstract:Detecting MLH1 promoter methylation is highly relevant to differentiate between possible Lynch syndrome patients or patients with sporadic causes of MLH1/PMS2 deficiency in colorectal (CRC) and endometrial cancers. Here, we aimed to develop a test for assessing MLH1 promoter methylation based in next generation sequencing (NGS), and to evaluate the concordance of MLH1 methylation and BRAF-V600 mutation status in CRC. For that, we performed a series of experiments with DNA from tumor, saliva and commercial control samples and our in house developed amplicon-based NGS test. In patients' samples, MLH1 methylation above 10% was only observed in tumors with MLH1/PMS2 loss. We confirmed the reproducibility and accuracy of MLH1 promoter analysis performing a serial dilution experiment with completely methylated and unmethylated control DNAs and a comparison between two NGS platforms (Ion Proton and Illumina). In MLH1/PMS2 deficient tumors, the MLH1 methylation status was concordant with the BRAF mutation status in 90% (18/20) of the cases. Our amplicon-based NGS test showed a great sensitivity and specificity for detecting MLH1 methylation in CRC samples, with a high agreement with the evaluation of BRAF mutation. This simple and affordable test could be used as a reflex test to identify patients with sporadic causes of MLH1/PMS2 deficiency in CRC, aiding to genetic test referral and identification of Lynch syndrome patients.|Cancer

Previous studies showed that the incidence of SSC is significantly higher in those who underwent allo-HSCT from HLA-mismatched donors, suggesting that persistent alloimmunity may predispose patients to SSCs. It was recently reported that, in a cohort of patients who received allo-HSCT from an unrelated donor matched at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1/3/4/5, and -DQB1 loci, HLA-DPB1 alloimmunity determined by high mismatched eplets (MEs) and Predicted Indirectly Recognizable HLA Epitopes (PIRCHE) score (PS), was associated with relapse protection and increased risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).|Cancer
ID:36751054|Title:Genomic profiling and prognostic factors of H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord diffuse glioma.Abstract:H3 K27-altered diffuse midline glioma is a highly lethal pediatric-type tumor without efficacious treatments. Recent findings have highlighted the heterogeneity among diffuse midline gliomas with different locations and ages. Compared to tumors located in the brain stem and thalamus, the molecular and clinicopathological features of H3 K27-altered spinal cord glioma are still largely elusive, thus hindering the accurate management of patients. Here we aimed to characterize the clinicopathological and molecular features of H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord glioma in 77 consecutive cases. We found that the H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord glioma, with a median age of 35 years old, had a significantly better prognosis than H3 K27M-mutant brain tumors. We noticed a molecular heterogeneity of H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord astrocytoma via targeted sequencing with 34 cases. TP53 mutation which occurred in 58.8% of cases is mutually exclusive with PPM1D (26%) and NF1 (44%) mutations. The TP53-mutant cases had a significantly higher number of copy number variants (CNV) and a marginally higher proportion of pediatric patients (age at diagnosis <18 years old, p = 0.056). Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that the higher number of CNV events (≥3), chromosome (Chr) 9p deletion, Chr 10p deletion, ATRX mutation, CDK6 amplification, and retinoblastoma protein (RB) pathway alteration are associated with worse survival. Cox regression analysis with clinicopathological features showed that glioblastoma histological type and a high Ki-67 index (>10%) are associated with a worse prognosis. Interestingly, the histological type, an independent prognostic factor in multivariate Cox regression, can also stratify molecular features of H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord glioma, including the RB pathway, KRAS/PI3K pathway, and chromosome arms CNV. In conclusion, although all H3 K27M-mutant spinal cord diffuse glioma were diagnosed as WHO Grade 4, the histological type, molecular features representing chromatin instability, and molecular alterations associated with accelerated cell proliferative activity should not be ignored in clinical management.|Cancer
ID:36764880|Title:Clinical utility of axillary nodal markers in breast cancer.Abstract:De-escalation of axillary surgery for lymph node (LN) positive breast cancer is facilitated by marking involved nodes which, when removed with sentinel nodes constitute risk-adapted targeted axillary dissection (TAD). Whether after chemotherapy or for primary surgery, selected patients with biopsy-proven involvement of nodes may be eligible for axillary conservation. Likewise, impalpable recurrence or stage 4 patients with localised axillary disease may benefit. In these contexts, several devices are used to mark biopsied nodes to facilitate their accurate surgical removal. We report our experience using the paramagnetic MAGSEED (Endomag®, Cambridge, UK).|Cancer
ID:36779536|Title:BRAF V600E and RNF43 Co-mutations Predict Patient Outcomes With Targeted Therapies in Real-World Cases of Colorectal Cancer.Abstract:Anti-BRAF/EGFR therapy is approved for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with BRAFV600E mutations, although not all patients respond. Novel recent findings indicate the potential of RNF43 mutations to predict outcomes in patients with BRAF-mutated microsatellite stable (MSS) mCRC treated with anti-BRAF/EGFR therapy. This study aimed to independently and rapidly validate BRAFV600E/RNF43 co-mutations as predictive biomarkers of benefit to anti-EGFR/BRAF therapy. Clinical data were derived from electronic health record data from ~280 US cancer clinics between January 2011 and March 2022 from the Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine real-world clinico-genomic mCRC database. Real-world cases of BRAFV600E-mutated mCRC, with patients receiving anti-BRAF/EGFR therapy (n = 49), were included. Patients who were MSS, with RNF43 mutations, had favorable progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.29; 95% CI [CI], 0.13-0.65) and overall survival (HR 0.32, 95% CI, 0.12-0.84) compared with wild type. No difference in outcomes was observed between patient groups with RNF43-mutant versus wild-type receiving standard-of-care chemotherapy. BRAFV600E/RNF43 co-mutations predict mCRC anti-BRAF/EGFR outcomes in diverse clinical settings.|Cancer

ID:36787023|Title:Comparison of the radiomics-based predictive models using machine learning and nomogram for epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status and subtypes in lung adenocarcinoma.Abstract:The purpose of this study is to develop the predictive models for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status and subtypes [exon 21-point mutation (L858R) and exon 19 deletion mutation (19Del)] and evaluate their clinical usefulness. Total 172 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were retrospectively analyzed. The analysis of variance and the least absolute shrinkage were used for feature selection from plain computed tomography images. Then, radiomic score (rad-score) was calculated for the training and test cohorts. Two machine learning (ML) models with 5-fold were applied to construct the predictive models with rad-score, clinical features, and the combination of rad-score and clinical features. The nomogram was developed using rad-score and clinical features. The prediction performance was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Finally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed using the best ML and nomogram models. In the test cohorts, the AUC of the best ML and the nomogram model were 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.87) and 0.79 (0.65-0.92) in the EGFR mutation groups, 0.83 (0.67-0.99) and 0.85 (0.72-0.97) in the L858R mutation groups, as well as 0.77 (0.58-0.97) and 0.77 (0.60-0.95) in the 19Del groups. The DCA showed that the nomogram models have comparable results with ML models. We constructed two predictive models for EGFR mutation status and subtypes. The nomogram models had comparable results to the ML models. Because the superiority of the performance of ML and nomogram models varied depending on the prediction groups, appropriate model selection is necessary.|Cancer
ID:36788105|Title:PDGFRB and NOTCH3 Mutations are Detectable in a Wider Range of Pericytic Tumors, Including Myopericytomas, Angioleiomyomas, Glomus Tumors, and Their Combined Tumors.Abstract:Pericytic tumors are subclassified as myopericytomas, myofibromas, angioleiomyomas, and glomus tumors according to the current World Health Organization classification. These pericytic tumors form a continuous morphologic spectrum, including those with combined morphology. However, to our knowledge, no widely accepted criteria for classifying tumors with combined morphology are available. Recent studies have identified platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRB) gene mutations in a subset of myofibromas, myopericytomas, and myopericytomatoses but not in angioleiomyomas. NOTCH receptor 3 (NOTCH3) mutations have been reported in a subset of infantile myofibromatosis. To assess their potential role in classifying pericytic tumors, we investigated PDGFRB and NOTCH3 mutations in 41 pericytic tumors of variable morphology, including some combined forms. Our results show these mutations to be present in a variety of pericytic tumors, such as myopericytomas (PDGFRB, 3/11; NOTCH3, 4/11), myopericytomatoses (1/2; 1/2), myofibromas (3/6; 0/6), angioleiomyomas (2/13; 3/13), and glomus tumors (5/9; 1/9). Point mutations were identified in 3 tumors in PDGFRB exon 12 (Y562C, S574F, and G576S), 12 tumors in PDGFRB exon 14 (M655I, H657L, and N666K), and 9 tumors in NOTCH3 exon 25 (A1480S/T, D1481N, G1482S, T1490A, E1491K, G1494S, and V1512A). All PDGFRB mutations and NOTCH3 G1482S, T1490A, and G1494S mutations were classified as "deleterious/damaging" by ≥4 of 6 pathogenicity prediction tools in silico. Five-mutation-positive tumors, including 1 myopericytoma-angioleiomyoma, 2 myopericytomatoses-myofibroma, 1 myofibroma-myopericytoma and 1 angioleiomyoma-myopericytoma, were of combined morphology. Therefore, we found PDGFRB and NOTCH3 mutations to be detectable in a much wider variety of pericytic tumors than previously reported and confirmed myopericytomas, myofibromas, angioleiomyomas, and glomus tumors as members harboring PDGFRB or NOTCH3 mutations. Our results thus suggest that PDGFRB or NOTCH3 mutations are not useful for subclassifying members of the pericytic tumor family.|Cancer

ID:36790533|Title:The PER3<sup>rs772027021</sup> SNP induces pigmentation phenotypes of dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria.Abstract:Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH) is a pigmentary genodermatosis characterized by a mixture of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules distributed randomly over the body. Although Sterile Alpha motif- and SH3 domain-containing protein 1 (SASH1) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 6 (ABCB6) have been identified as causative genes for this disorder, some cases involve unknown pathogenic genes. In this study, whole-exome sequencing, data analysis, and Sanger sequencing were utilized for a four-generation extended Chinese family with DUH. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (c. 517C > T (p.P173S), rs772027021) variant in exon 5 of Period Circadian Regulator 3 (PER3) (NM_001289861) was detected in each affected individual of the DUH family; the c. 517C > T SNP of PER3 (PER3<sup>rs772027021</sup> SNP) and a novel mutation in exon 14 of SASH1 (c. 1574C > G (p.T525R)) were both found in the proband. The affected individuals carrying PER3<sup>rs772027021</sup> SNP in this family demonstrated mild-pigmented phenotypes compared to those of the proband carrying PER3<sup>rs772027021</sup> SNP and SASH1 <sup>T525R</sup> mutation. Increased melanin synthesis was induced by PER3<sup>rs772027021</sup> SNP in the melanocytes of affected epithelial tissues. Mutated SASH1 or PER3<sup>rs772027021</sup> SNP alone or cooperation of mutation of SASH1 and PER3<sup>rs772027021</sup> SNP synergistically led to increased melanin synthesis and enhanced proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro. We also phenotypically characterized a commercially available zebrafish mutant line harboring the PER3<sup>rs772027021</sup> SNP to induce melanocyte proliferation in vivo. Our results are the first to reveal that this PER3 SNP may be pathogenic for a novel DUH subtype with mild hyperpigmented and/or hypopigmented phenotypes and that mutation of SASH1 and PER3 cooperatively promotes hyperpigmentation phenotypes. KEY MESSAGES: PER3 <sup>rs772027021</sup> SNP is identified to be associated with hyperpigmentation and/or hypopigmentation phenotype and the novel pathogenic variant of PER3 <sup>rs772027021</sup> SNP probably contributed the pathogenesis of DUH.

We evaluated both agents in a perioperative phase 1 trial to explore the mechanism of action in recurrent low-grade glioma (IGG) and select a molecule for phase 3 testing. Primary end-point was concentration of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), the metabolic product of mIDH enzymes, measured in tumor tissue from 49 patients with mIDH1-R132H nonenhancing gliomas following randomized treatment with vorasidenib (50 mg or 10 mg once daily, q.d.), ivosidenib (500 mg q.d. or 250 mg twice daily) or no treatment before surgery. Tumor 2-HG concentrations were reduced by 92.6% (95% credible interval (CrI), 76.1-97.6) and 91.1% (95% CrI, 72.0-97.0) in patients treated with vorasidenib 50 mg q.d. and ivosidenib 500 mg q.d., respectively. Both agents were well tolerated and follow-up is ongoing. In exploratory analyses, 2-HG reduction was associated with increased DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, reversal of 'proneural' and 'stemness' gene expression signatures, decreased tumor cell proliferation and immune cell activation. Vorasidenib, which showed brain penetrance and more consistent 2-HG suppression than ivosidenib, was advanced to phase 3 testing in patients with mIDH LGGs.

ID:36835468|Title:The Anti-Tumorigenic Role of Cannabinoid Receptor 2 in Colon Cancer: A Study in Mice and Humans.Abstract:The endocannabinoid system, particularly cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2 in mice and CNR2 in humans), has controversial pathophysiological implications in colon cancer. Here, we investigate the role of CB2 in potentiating the immune response in colon cancer in mice and determine the influence of <i>CNR2</i> variants in humans. Comparing wild-type (WT) mice to CB2 knockout (CB2<sup>-/-</sup>) mice, we performed a spontaneous cancer study in aging mice and subsequently used the AOM/DSS model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer and a model for hereditary colon cancer (Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>). Additionally, we analyzed genomic data in a large human population to determine the relationship between <i>CNR2</i> variants and colon cancer incidence. Aging CB2<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited a higher incidence of spontaneous precancerous lesions in the colon compared to WT controls. The AOM/DSS-treated CB2<sup>-/-</sup> and Apc<sup>Min/+</sup>CB2<sup>-/-</sup> mice experienced aggravated tumorigenesis and enhanced splenic populations of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells along with abated anti-tumor CD8+ T cells. Importantly, corroborative genomic data reveal a significant association between non-synonymous variants of <i>CNR2</i> and the incidence of colon cancer in humans. Taken together, the results suggest that endogenous CB2 activation suppresses colon tumorigenesis by shifting the balance towards anti-tumor immune cells in mice and thus portray the prognostic value of <i>CNR2</i> variants for colon cancer patients.|Cancer

ID:36857646|Title:Rational design of nonlinear hybridization immunosensor chain reactions for simultaneous ultrasensitive detection of two tumor marker proteins.Abstract:Sensitive biomarker detection techniques are beneficial for both disease diagnosis and postoperative examinations. The nonlinear hybridization chain reaction (NHCR) is widely used as an output signal amplification technique for biosensor platforms. A novel hairpin-free NHCR was developed in this study as a flow cytometric immunoassay to detect alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and prostate specific antigen (PSA). First, the target AFP is captured on magnetic beads (MBs) that are modified with capture antibodies. Then, the prepared biotin-streptavidin-biotin (B-S-B) system, which links biotinylated detection antibodies and biotinylated trigger DNA together through the high affinity between biotin-streptavidin interaction, is added to label the target AFP, forming a sandwich complex with three trigger DNA chains. Each trigger DNA chain grows a dendritic DNA nanostructure following a nonlinear hybridization chain reaction. As the substrate flue chains are labeled with fluorophores, the self-assembly process of dendritic DNA is accompanied by the continuous release of fluorophores. Dendrites with strong fluorescence then form on the surface of MBs. Finally, the target AFP is quantified by analyzing the fluorescent MBs using flow cytometry. The proposed immunoassay has a high selectivity along with isothermal, enzyme-free, and exponential amplification efficiency. It shows a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.74 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>. The proposed biosensor was also successfully used to quantitatively detect AFP in serum samples. It may be utilized to detect multiple tumor markers simultaneously by changing the size of MBs and antibody-antigen pairs. Most tumor markers are only related to tumor diagnosis but without specificity, so the combined detection of multiple tumor markers can improve the accuracy of early tumor diagnoses.|Cancer
ID:36859545|Title:Blebs promote cell survival by assembling oncogenic signalling hubs.Abstract:Most human cells require anchorage for survival. Cell-substrate adhesion activates diverse signalling pathways, without which cells undergo anoikis-a form of programmed cell death<sup>1</sup>. Acquisition of anoikis resistance is a pivotal step in cancer disease progression, as metastasizing cells often lose firm attachment to surrounding tissue<sup>2,3</sup>. In these poorly attached states, cells adopt rounded morphologies and form small hemispherical plasma membrane protrusions called blebs<sup>4-11</sup>. Bleb function has been thoroughly investigated in the context of amoeboid migration, but it has been examined far less in other scenarios<sup>12</sup>. Here we show by three-dimensional imaging and manipulation of cell morphological states that blebbing triggers the formation of plasma membrane-proximal signalling hubs that confer anoikis resistance. Specifically, in melanoma cells, blebbing generates plasma membrane contours that recruit curvature-sensing septin proteins as scaffolds for constitutively active mutant NRAS and effectors. These signalling hubs activate ERK and PI3K-well-established promoters of pro-survival pathways. Inhibition of blebs or septins has little effect on the survival of well-adhered cells, but in detached cells it causes NRAS mislocalization, reduced MAPK and PI3K activity, and ultimately, death. This unveils a morphological requirement for mutant NRAS to operate as an effective oncoprotein. Furthermore, whereas some BRAF-mutated melanoma cells do not rely on this survival pathway in a basal state, inhibition of BRAF and MEK strongly sensitizes them to both bleb and septin inhibition. Moreover, fibroblasts engineered to sustain blebbing acquire the same anoikis resistance as cancer cells even without harbouring oncogenic mutations. Thus, blebs are potent signalling organelles capable of integrating myriad cellular information flows into concerted cellular responses, in this case granting robust anoikis resistance.|Cancer

However, unmet needs remain, including treatment of patients with resistance mutations, efficacy in brain metastasis and avoidance of neurological side effects. Taletrectinib was designed to: improve efficacy; overcome resistance to first-generation ROS1 inhibitors; and address brain metastasis while conferring fewer neurological adverse events. All of these features are demonstrated and supported by the interim data from the regional phase II TRUST-I clinical study. Here we describe the rationale and design of TRUST-II, a global phase II study of taletrectinib in patients with locally advanced/metastatic ROS1<sup>+</sup> non-small-cell lung cancer and other ROS1<sup>+</sup> solid tumors.

Twenty-nine patients are enrolled in the study. The objective response rate (ORR) is 60%, and the R0 resection rate is 90% (9/10). The 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate and 12-month overall survival (OS) rate are 64% and 72%, respectively. Grade 3 or higher adverse events are anemia (8%), thrombocytopenia (8%), and jaundice (8%). Circulating tumor DNA analysis reveals that patients with a >50% decline in maximal somatic variant allelic frequency (maxVAF) between the first clinical evaluation and baseline have a longer survival outcome and a higher response rate and surgical rate than those who are not. PD-1 blockade plus chemoradiotherapy as preoperative therapy displays promising antitumor activity, and multiomics potential predictive biomarkers are identified and warrant further verification.|Cancer

Further anoikis based risk stratification is expected to provide a deeper understanding of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) carcinogenesis. <b>Methods:</b> The information of STAD patients were acquired from TCGA dataset. Anoikis-related genes were obtained from the Molecular Signatures Database and Pearson correlation analysis was performed to identify the anoikis-related lncRNAs (ARLs). We performed machine learning algorithms, including Univariate Cox regression and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) analyses on the ARLs to build the OS-score and OS-signature. Clinical subgroup analysis, tumor mutation burden (TMB) detection, drug susceptibility analysis, immune infiltration and pathway enrichment analysis were further performed to comprehensive explore the clinical significance. <b>Results:</b> We established a STAD prognostic model based on five ARLs and its prognostic value was verified. Survival analysis showed that the overall survival of high-risk score patients was significantly shorter than that of low-risk score patients. The column diagrams show satisfactory discrimination and calibration. The calibration curve verifies the good agreement between the prediction of the line graph and the actual observation. TIDE analysis and drug sensitivity analysis showed significant differences between different risk groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> The novel prognostic model based on anoikis-related lncRNAs we identified could be used for prognosis prediction and precise therapy in gastric adenocarcinoma.|Cancer
ID:36926316|Title:Disruption of estrogen receptor beta's DNA binding domain impairs its tumor suppressive effects in triple negative breast cancer.Abstract:Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive sub-type of the disease which accounts for a disproportionately high percentage of breast cancer morbidities and mortalities. For these reasons, a better understanding of TNBC biology is required and the development of novel therapeutic approaches are critically needed. Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) is a reported tumor suppressor that is expressed in approximately 20% of primary TNBC tumors, where it is associated with favorable prognostic features and patient outcomes. Previous studies have shown that ERβ mediates the assembly of co-repressor complexes on DNA to inhibit the expression of multiple growth promoting genes and to suppress the ability of oncogenic transcription factors to drive cancer progression. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which ERβ elicits its anti-cancer effects, we developed MDA-MB-231 cells that inducibly express a mutant form of ERβ incapable of directly binding DNA. We demonstrate that disruption of ERβ's direct interaction with DNA abolishes its ability to regulate the expression of well characterized immediate response genes and renders it unable to suppress TNBC cell proliferation. Loss of DNA binding also diminishes the ability of ERβ to suppress oncogenic NFκB signaling even though it still physically associates with NFκB and other critical co-factors. These findings enhance our understanding of how ERβ functions in this disease and provide a model system that can be utilized to further investigate the mechanistic processes by which ERβ elicits its anti-cancer effects.|Cancer

ID:36927893|Title:[Orthopaedic Management of Bone Metastasis].Abstract:Thanks to advancement in cancer therapy, an increasing number of cancer patients are expected to live longer with cancer in Japan. Activities of daily living(ADL)and quality of life(QOL)of cancer patients has become much more important than ever. Because a decline in mobility negatively affects ADL and QOL, the management of locomotive organs of cancer patients is crucial. In 2018, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association decided their annual activity theme as"locomotive syndrome in cancer patients", with the concept of preventing and improving locomotive syndrome for longer and healthier life of cancer patients. Bone metastasis, as a major cause of locomotive syndrome in cancer patients, needs to be evaluated and managed properly for better ADL and QOL of cancer patients. Pathological fractures, spinal instability, and spinal injury cause not only severe pain and massive functional impairment of patients but increased nursing care burden. To resolve these problems, surgery plays a major role. Possible surgical procedures include internal fixation, curettage, cementation, and arthroplasty for the long bones, whereas percutaneous vertebroplasty, decompression, posterior/anterior spinal fusion, and total en bloc spondylectomy for the spine. Less invasive surgical procedure tends to be chosen for a patient with poorer prognosis. The main purpose of bone metastasis surgery is to maintain ADL and QOL of cancer patients hopefully during the remaining survival time; therefore, estimated survival should be considered when determining the surgical strategy. In addition, case-by- case careful peri-operative management is required because cancer therapy can vary widely in patient age, cancer type, and tumor stage. To accommodate the variety of orthopaedic surgeries to the diversity of cancer therapy, the corporation between oncologists and orthopaedic surgeons is indispensable.|Cancer
ID:36928082|Title:CDX-2 expression correlates with clinical outcomes in MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors.Abstract:Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) showed efficacy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with mismatch-repair deficiency or high microsatellite instability (dMMR-MSI-H). Unfortunately, a patient's subgroup did not benefit from immunotherapy. Caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX-2) would seem to influence immunotherapy's sensitivity, promoting the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14 (CXCL14) expression. Therefore, we investigated CDX-2 role as a prognostic-predictive marker in patients with mCRC MSI-H. We retrospectively collected data from 14 MSI-H mCRC patients treated with ICIs between 2019 and 2021. The primary endpoint was the 12-month progression-free-survival (PFS) rate. The secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), PFS, objective response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR). The PFS rate at 12 months was 81% in CDX-2 positive patients vs 0% in CDX-2 negative patients (p = 0.0011). The median PFS was not reached (NR) in the CDX-2 positive group versus 2.07 months (95%CI 2.07-10.8) in CDX-2 negative patients (p = 0.0011). Median OS was NR in CDX-2-positive patients versus 2.17 months (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.17-18.7) in CDX2-negative patients (p = 0.026). All CDX-2-positive patients achieved a disease response, one of them a complete response. Among CDX-2-negative patients, one achieved stable disease, while the other progressed rapidly (ORR: 100% vs 0%, p = 0.0005; DCR: 100% vs 50%, p = 0.02). Twelve patients received 1st-line pembrolizumab (11 CDX-2 positive and 1 CDX-2 negative) not reaching median PFS, while two patients (1 CDX-2 positive and 1 CDX-2 negative) received 3rd-line pembrolizumab reaching a median PFS of 10.8 months (95% CI, 10.8-12.1; p = 0.036). Although our study reports results on a small population, the prognostic role of CDX-2 in CRC seems confirmed and could drive a promising predictive role in defining the population more sensitive to immunotherapy treatment. Modulating the CDX-2/CXCL14 axis in CDX-2-negative patients could help overcome primary resistance to immunotherapy.|Cancer
ID:36928336|Title:Establishing an RNA fusions panel in soft tissue sarcoma with clinical validation.Abstract:The diagnosis and classification of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) remain challenging because of the rarity and overlapping morphologic manifestations of diverse STS subtypes. Characteristic gene fusions are commonly detected in STS and represent useful diagnostic markers. This study established and validated a custom-designed RNA sequencing panel that identified 64 gene fusions in STS. The analytical performance validation yielded excellent accuracy, with 100% (95% CI, 94.40%-100%) sensitivity and 93.33% (95% CI, 68.05%-99.83%) specificity. Clinical performances were further confirmed with 145 clinical formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from STS patients. Fusions were detected in 40% of samples (58/145). The common fusions SS18-SSX family, EWSR1-related fusions, COL1A1-PDGFB, FOXO1-associated fusions, and FUS-associated fusions were identified in corresponding STS subtypes. The RNA panel detected specific fusions in several cases where no conclusive diagnosis can be made based on the morphology and immunohistochemistry results. Data collected in this study demonstrate that the RNA fusions panel can better classify STS subtypes and serve as a good supplement for histopathology, exhibiting a great potential for the STS precise diagnosis.|Cancer
ID:36928393|Title:[Genetic testing in epithelial ovarian cancer: implementation of the 'Tumor-First' workflow].Abstract:The new 'Tumor-First' workflow for genetic testing in epithelial ovarian cancer detects women with a genetic predisposition effectively and efficiently. 'Tumor-First' indicates that the tumor DNA of all patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer is examined for the presence of pathogenic variants in, amongst others, BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Women with an aberrant tumor DNA test result are eligible for genetic testing using a sample of blood to detect heredity. Simultaneously, the tumor DNA test provides information on the effectiveness of additional treatment with PARP inhibitors. Thereby, the Tumor-First workflow saves time and healthcare costs. This workflow is currently implemented on a national level. The focus of implementation is transferring knowledge to healthcare professionals on requesting, interpreting and reporting the tumor DNA test and providing adequate support. This nationwide implementation of Tumor-First can improve the recognition of heredity in epithelial ovarian cancer.|Cancer
ID:36928584|Title:Toripalimab combined with lenvatinib and GEMOX is a promising regimen as first-line treatment for advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: a single-center, single-arm, phase 2 study.Abstract:Advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has a dismal prognosis. Here, we report the efficacy and safety of combining toripalimab, lenvatinib, and gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX) as first-line therapy for advanced ICC. Thirty patients with pathologically confirmed advanced ICC received intravenous gemcitabine (1 g/m<sup>2</sup>) on Days 1 and 8 and oxaliplatin (85 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) Q3W for six cycles along with intravenous toripalimab (240 mg) Q3W and oral lenvatinib (8 mg) once daily for one year. The expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and genetic status was investigated in paraffin-embedded tissues using immunohistochemistry and whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes included safety, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR) and duration of response (DoR). As of July 1, 2022, the median follow-up time was 23.5 months, and the ORR was 80%. Twenty-three patients achieved partial response, and one achieved complete response. Patients (21/30) with DNA damage response (DDR)-related gene mutations showed a higher ORR, while patients (14/30) with tumor area positivity ≥1 (PD-L1 staining) showed a trend of high ORR, but without significant difference. The median OS, PFS, and DoR were 22.5, 10.2, and 11.0 months, respectively. The DCR was 93.3%. Further, 56.7% of patients experienced manageable grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs), commonly neutropenia (40.0%) and leukocytopenia (23.3%). In conclusion, toripalimab plus lenvatinib and GEMOX are promising first-line regimens for the treatment of advanced ICC. A phase-III, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized study to validate our findings was approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA, No. 2021LP01825).Trial registration Clinical trials: NCT03951597.|Cancer
ID:36928600|Title:Characterization of pancreatic cancer with ultra-low tumor mutational burden.Abstract:In pancreatic cancer (PC), Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has been reported to be lower than in other cancers, with its clinical significance remaining unclear. We analyzed the dataset of whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiling of 93 resected PC cases. The median TMB was 0.24. The TMB was classified as High (≥ 5.0), Low (< 5.0, ≥ 1.0), or Ultra-low (< 1.0). Nineteen samples (20%) were classified as TMB-low, and 74 (80%) were classified as TMB-ultra-low; no samples were TMB-high. TMB-ultra-low PC had significantly fewer borderline resectable lesions (P = 0.028) and fewer adenosquamous carcinomas (P = 0.003) than TBM-low PC. Furthermore, the TMB-ultra-low PC showed significantly lower detection rates of driver mutations and copy number variations. Microsatellite instability was not significantly correlated with the TMB status. The TMB-ultra-low PC had a significantly better prognosis than TBM-low PC (P = 0.023). A multivariate analysis identified TMB-ultra-low PC as an independent favorable prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 2.11; P = 0.019). A gene expression analysis showed that TMB-ultra-low PC was associated with reduced TP53 inactivation (P = 0.003) and reduced chromosomal instability (P = 0.001) compared to TBM-low PC. TMB-ultra-low PC had specific gene expression signatures and a better prognosis than TMB-low PC.|Cancer
ID:36929074|Title:Statistical Methods for Integrative Clustering of Multi-omics Data.Abstract:Cancers are heterogeneous diseases caused by accumulated mutations or abnormal alterations at multi-levels of biological processes including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. There is a great clinical interest in identifying cancer molecular subtypes for disease prognosis and personalized medicine. Integrative clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning method that has been increasingly used to identify cancer molecular subtypes using multi-omics data including somatic mutations, DNA copy numbers, DNA methylation, and gene expression. Integrative clustering methods are generally classified into model-based or nonparametric approaches. In this chapter, we will give an overview of the frequently used model-based methods, including iCluster, iClusterPlus, and iClusterBayes, and the nonparametric method, integrative nonnegative matrix factorization (intNMF). We will use the integrative analyses of uveal melanoma and lower-grade glioma to illustrate these representative methods. Finally, we will discuss the strengths and limitations of these representative methods and give suggestions for performing integrative analyses of cancer multi-omics data in practice.|Cancer

ID:36929451|Title:Integration of clinical and spatial data to explore lipid metabolism-related genes for predicting prognosis and immune microenvironment in gliomas.Abstract:Lipid metabolism is crucial to tumor growth and immune microenvironment as well as drug sensitivity in glioma. Identifying prognostic indicators of glioma and elucidating the mechanisms of glioma progression are critical for improving the prognosis of glioma patients. In this study, we investigated the role and prognostic value of metabolism-related genes in glioma by integrative analysis of datasets from GEO, CGGA, and TCGA. Based on clinical data and transcriptome data, we found that the expression pattern of three major pathways related to lipid metabolism is fatty acid<sup>high</sup>-phospholipid<sup>high</sup>-triglyceride<sup>low</sup>, which is associated with better prognosis and immune infiltration. The genes involved in these three pathways were used to generate a prognostic model, which showed high stability and efficiency in the test set and validation set. The spatial transcriptome of glioma patients revealed that the microenvironment of the regions with high expression of risk genes CAV1 and SCD is in a state of hypoxia, EMT, and cell cycle arrest, and thus can be used as markers of metabolic reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment. In the high-risk group, M0 macrophages and M1 macrophages were significantly enriched, and the risk score was significantly correlated with gene mutation and methylation of risk genes. We further performed drug sensitivity screening corresponding to different risk genes. This study provided novel insights into the differential immune microenvironment with different expression patterns of metablism-related genes and highlighted the spatial and temporal synergy of tumor progression and metabolic reprogramming.|Cancer

ID:36929593|Title:Large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumour: molecular and immunohistochemical assessment of a series comprising non-metastasising and metastasising neoplasms.Abstract:Large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumour (LCCSCT) is a type of testicular sex cord-stromal tumour that may occur sporadically or in the context of Carney complex and other genetic syndromes. A subset is clinically malignant, and the molecular mechanisms that drive such aggressive behaviour remain unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed 21 samples from 20 patients with LCCSCT (12 non-metastasising and eight metastasising) using PRKAR1A immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing. All tumours except two (cases 17 and 20, both metastasising) demonstrated loss of PRKAR1A expression. Among 11 cases with interpretable sequencing results, all harboured pathogenic single nucleotide variants of PRKAR1A. Evidence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of PRKAR1A was present in all tumours with interpretable zygosity data, but the mechanisms of LOH were different for non-metastasising and metastasising tumours. Non-metastasising tumours demonstrated only copy-neutral LOH, while metastasising tumours demonstrated a spectrum of mechanisms of LOH, including copy-loss LOH, two concurrent mutations or copy-neutral LOH. Relevant molecular findings in non-metastasising LCCSCT were limited to PRKAR1A variants. In contrast, all metastasising LCCSCTs with interpretable data harboured additional pathogenic variants, including (but not restricted to) BRCA2 mutations with evidence of LOH and bi-allelic CDKN2A/B deletions. Three patients harboured PRKAR1A variants of inferred germline origin, including one with Carney complex and two without known syndromic features. CONCLUSIONS: This study further confirms that PRKAR1A IHC is a useful diagnostic tool for both non-metastasising and metastasising tumours and suggests that molecular analyses can be helpful to identify non-metastasising tumours with malignant potential in selected patients. Importantly, these results highlight that germline assessment could be beneficial for all patients presenting with LCCSCT.|Cancer
ID:36930079|Title:IKZF3 is a novel prognostic biomarker for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: A study based on bioinformatics analysis.Abstract:In the past few years, immunotherapy of tumors has become an extensive research hotspot, and the value of IKZF family genes in the tumor microenvironment has also been increasingly recognized. However, the expression of the IKAROS family zinc finger 3 (IKZF3) gene in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and its prognostic value were not reported for the main subset until now. In the present study, we analyzed the relationship between IKZF3 gene expression and the survival of HNSCC patients. To evaluate the potential of IKZF3 as a prognostic biomarker for HNSCC comprehensively, multiple online analysis tools, including UALCAN, cBioPortal, GEPIA, WebGestalt, String, Genomic Data Commons, and TIMER databases were utilized in our study. We observed that the HNSCC patients with higher IKZF3 expression tended to exhibit longer overall survival. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that age and grade were independent prognostic indicators in HNSCC. Moreover, Gene Ontology and KEGG function enrichment analyses showed that several pathways in HNSCC might be pivotal pathways regulated by IKZF3, which revealed that IKZF3 was probably participating in the occurrence and development of HNSCC. Furthermore, the hypomethylation of the IKZF3 gene was closely associated with genes that observed mutation in HNSCC. IKZF3 was significantly correlated with several immune cells in HNSCC (e.g., CD8+ T cell, CD4+ cell, and dendritic cell). We explored the potential prognostic values and roles of the IKZF3 in HNSCC, revealing that IKZF3 was probably a novel and reliable prognostic biomarker for patients with HNSCC.|Cancer

ID:36930112|Title:Comprehensive analysis of pan-cancer reveals the potential of SLC16A1 as a prognostic and immunological biomarker.Abstract:SLC16A1 plays an important role in the development of multiple cancer types. Pan-cancer analysis may have significant impacts on the exploration of the relationship between SLC16A1 gene expression, prognosis and the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis. In this study, through the analysis of TCGA and GEO datasets, we explored the expression level and survival prognosis of SLC16A1 in pan-cancer, and further explored the differences in SLC16A1 gene mutation, methylation, and phosphorylation between tumor and normal tissues. In addition, we focused on the biological function of this gene and the relationship between the prognosis and immune infiltration by immune infiltration analysis and enrichment analysis, in order to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic significance of SLC16A1 in carcinomas. The study found that SLC16A1 was highly expressed in 14 kinds of tumors, and there were statistically significant differences in the prognosis of 9 tumors. The phosphorylation level of S467 increased in OV, RCC, and UCEC. There was a statistically negative correlation between the CD8+ T-cell infiltration level and the SLC16A1 expression in HNSC, LUSC, SARC, TGCT, and KIRC. The cancer-related fibroblasts were positively correlated with SLC16A1 expression in BLCA, BRCA, KIRC, KIRP, PAAD, PCPG, and THCA. The enrichment analysis indicated that the tumorigenesis mechanism of this gene was mainly related to "glycolysis and glucose metabolism synthesis." SLC16A1 was a promising prognostic and immunological biomarker in pan-cancer.|Cancer
ID:36930129|Title:Rectum adenocarcinoma metabolic subtypes analysis and a risk prognostic model construction based on fatty acid metabolism genes.Abstract:Fatty acid metabolism is an essential part of cancer research due to its role in cancer initiation and progression. However, its characteristics and prognostic value in rectum adenocarcinoma have not been systematically evaluated. We collected fatty acid metabolism gene expression profiles and clinical information from the cancer genome atlas and gene expression omnibus databases. After excluding individuals lacking clinical information and the presence of genetic mutations, we performed consistent clustering of the remaining patients and selected stable clustering results to group patients. Differentially expressed genes and gene set enrichment analysis were compared between subgroups, while metabolic signature identification and decoding the tumor microenvironment were performed. In addition, we explored the survival status of patients among different subgroups and identified signature genes affecting survival by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Finally, we selected signature genes to construct a risk prognostic model by multivariate Cox regression and evaluated model efficacy by univariate Cox regression and the receiver operating characteristic curve. By consensus clustering, patients were distinguished into 2 stable subpopulations, gene set enrichment analysis and metabolic signature identification effectively defined 2 completely different subtypes of fatty acid metabolism: fatty acid catabolic subtype and fatty acid anabolic subtype. Among them, patients with the fatty acid catabolic subtype had a poorer prognosis, with a significantly lower proportion of myeloid dendritic cells infiltration within the tumor microenvironment. Aquaporin 7 (hazard ratio, HR = 2.064 (1.4408-4.5038); P < .01), X inactive specific transcript (HR = (0.3758-0.7564), P = .045) and interleukin 4 induced 1 (HR = 1.34 (1.13-1.59); P = .034), were selected by multivariate Cox regression, which constructed a risk prognostic model. The independent hazard ratio of the model was 2.72 and the area under curve was higher than age, gender and tumor stage, showing better predictive efficacy. Our study revealed the heterogeneity of fatty acid metabolism in rectum adenocarcinoma, defined 2 completely distinct subtypes of fatty acid metabolism, and finally established a novel fatty acid metabolism-related risk prognostic model. The study contributes to the early risk assessment and monitoring of individual prognosis and provides data to support individualized patient treatment.|Cancer

ID:36930678|Title:PCB: A pseudotemporal causality-based Bayesian approach to identify EMT-associated regulatory relationships of AS events and RBPs during breast cancer progression.Abstract:During breast cancer metastasis, the developmental process epithelial-mesenchymal (EM) transition is abnormally activated. Transcriptional regulatory networks controlling EM transition are well-studied; however, alternative RNA splicing also plays a critical regulatory role during this process. Alternative splicing was proved to control the EM transition process, and RNA-binding proteins were determined to regulate alternative splicing. A comprehensive understanding of alternative splicing and the RNA-binding proteins that regulate it during EM transition and their dynamic impact on breast cancer remains largely unknown. To accurately study the dynamic regulatory relationships, time-series data of the EM transition process are essential. However, only cross-sectional data of epithelial and mesenchymal specimens are available. Therefore, we developed a pseudotemporal causality-based Bayesian (PCB) approach to infer the dynamic regulatory relationships between alternative splicing events and RNA-binding proteins. Our study sheds light on facilitating the regulatory network-based approach to identify key RNA-binding proteins or target alternative splicing events for the diagnosis or treatment of cancers. The data and code for PCB are available at: http://hkumath.hku.hk/~wkc/PCB(data+code).zip.|Cancer
ID:36930754|Title:Nanoengineered Gallium Ion Incorporated Formulation for Safe and Efficient Reversal of PARP Inhibition and Platinum Resistance in Ovarian Cancer.Abstract:Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the main systemic treatment of ovarian cancer (OC). However, the inevitable development of platinum and poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) resistance is associated with poor outcomes, which becomes a major obstacle in the management of this disease. The present study developed "all-in-one" nanoparticles that contained the PARPi olaparib and gallium (Ga) (III) (olaparib-Ga) to effectively reverse PARPi resistance in platinum-resistant A2780-cis and SKOV3-cis OC cells and in SKOV3-cis tumor models. Notably, the olaparib-Ga suppressed SKOV3-cis tumor growth with negligible toxicity. Moreover, the suppression effect was more evident when combining olaparib-Ga with cisplatin or carboplatin, as evaluated in A2780-cis and SKOV3-cis cells. Mechanistically, the combined treatment induced DNA damage, which elicited the activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/AMT- and Rad3-related (ATR) checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1)/Chk2 signal transduction pathways. This led to the arrest of cell cycle progression at S and G<sub>2</sub>/M phases, which eventually resulted in apoptosis and cell death due to unrepairable DNA damage. In addition, effective therapeutic responses to olaparib-Ga and cisplatin combination or olaparib-Ga and carboplatin combination were observed in SKOV3-cis tumor-bearing animal models. Altogether, the present findings demonstrate that olaparib-Ga has therapeutic implications in platinum-resistant OC cells, and the combination of olaparib-Ga with cisplatin or carboplatin may be promising for treating patients with OC who exhibit resistance to both PARPi and platinum.|Cancer

ID:36931075|Title:Adjuvant durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC harbouring uncommon genomic alterations.Abstract:Adjuvant durvalumab is the standard of care for patients with stage III unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), without progression after concurrent chemo-radiation (CCRT). Patients with stage III NSCLC harbouring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements do not seem to benefit from durvalumab. Data are lacking about patients harbouring other driver genomic alterations (dGA). We performed a multicentre (N = 4, Netherlands and Italy) retrospective study including consecutive patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC and treated with CCRT-with or without adjuvant durvalumab-between 2016 and 2022. We enrolled 271 patients; 130 of which received adjuvant durvalumab. Sixty-six patients had dGA (41 KRAS mutations, 4 EGFR common mutations and 21 uncommon dGA). In the entire population, the median PFS was 24.9 months (95% CI 17.5-32.4) and 12.6 months (95% CI 9.0-16.1) with and without durvalumab (p = 0.001). In the dGA group (excluding common EGFR), mPFS was 12.3 months (95% CI 7.8-16.8) with and 7.6 (95% CI 3.4-11.9) without durvalumab (p = 0.038). For patients with KRAS mutations, mPFS was 12.3 months (95% CI 3.6-20.9) with and 7.2 months (95% CI 1.8-12.6) without durvalumab (p = 0.12). Among patients with uncommon dGA, mPFS was 12.9 months (95% CI 8.4-17.4) with and 7.6 months (95% CI 1.4-14) without durvalumab (p = 0.23). We have shown a meaningful survival benefit of adjuvant durvalumab in patients harbouring KRAS mutations and uncommon dGA. This is the largest stage III NSCLC cohort showing the efficacy of durvalumab in patients with uncommon dGA. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our results.|Cancer
ID:23318425|Title:DMAP1 is an essential regulator of ATM activity and function.Abstract:The hereditary autosomal recessive disease ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is caused by mutation in the DNA damage kinase ATM. ATM's main function is to orchestrate DNA repair, thereby maintaining genomic stability. ATM activity is increased in response to several stimuli, including ionising radiation (IR) and hypotonic stress. DNMT1-associated protein 1 (DMAP1) is a member of the TIP60-p400 histone acetyl transferase (HAT) complex, which acetylates histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16) to affect chromatin relaxation and modulate ATM activation. Here we demonstrate that DMAP1 is required for both modes of ATM activation. Knockdown of DMAP1 impaired IR-induced ATM activation and consequently resulted in radiosensitivity and impaired the G2/M checkpoint. Moreover, DMAP1 was also required for efficient ATM signalling in response to hypotonic stress. Overexpression of DMAP1 increased IR-induced ATM substrate phosphorylation, suggesting that DMAP1 function is rate limiting for ATM signalling. DMAP1 associated with TIP60-dependent HAT activity, and depletion of DMAP1 reduced H4K16 acetylation in response to DNA damage. Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors rescued IR-induced ATM signalling in Dmap1-depleted cells. These results suggest that DMAP1 is a critical regulator of ATM activity and function.|Non-Cancer
ID:23656349|Title:A clinical and genetic overview of 18 years neurofibromatosis type 1 molecular diagnostics in the Netherlands.Abstract:NF1 mutations are the underlying cause of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a neuro-cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (NCFC). Because of the clinical overlap between NCFCs, genetic analysis of NF1 is necessary to confirm a clinical diagnosis NF1. This report describes the clinical and genetic findings of 18 years of NF1 molecular diagnostics in the Netherlands. A pathogenic mutation was found in 59.3% (1178/1985) of the index patients, mostly de novo (73.8%). The majority of the index patients (64.3%) fulfilled the National Institute of Health NF1 criteria, a pathogenic mutation was found in 80.9% of these patients. Seventy-four percent of the index patients with an NF1 pathogenic mutation and not fulfilling the NF1 criteria is <12 years, in agreement with the fact that some NF1 symptoms appear after puberty. Genotype-phenotype correlations were studied for 527 index patients. NF1 patients with a type 1 microdeletion have a sixfold higher risk of special education vs NF1 patients with an intragenic mutation. No evidently milder NF1 phenotype for patients with a missense mutation was observed. Forty-six prenatal analyses were performed in 28 (2.4%) families, of which 29 (63%) showed heterozygosity for the familial pathogenic mutation. This indicates that there is a need for prenatal NF1 testing.|Non-Cancer
ID:23807778|Title:Adult-onset mastocytosis in the skin is highly suggestive of systemic mastocytosis.Abstract:Adult-onset urticaria pigmentosa/mastocytosis in the skin almost always persists throughout life. The prevalence of systemic mastocytosis in such patients is not precisely known. Bone marrow biopsies from 59 patients with mastocytosis in the skin and all available skin biopsies (n=27) were subjected to a meticulous cytological, histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular analysis for the presence of WHO-defined diagnostic criteria for systemic mastocytosis: compact mast cell infiltrates (major criterion); atypical mast cell morphology, KIT D816V, abnormal expression of CD25 by mast cells, and serum tryptase levels >20 ng/ml (minor criteria). Systemic mastocytosis is diagnosed when the major diagnostic criterion plus one minor criterion or at least three minor criteria are fulfilled. Systemic mastocytosis was confirmed in 57 patients (97%) by the diagnosis of compact mast cell infiltrates plus at least one minor diagnostic criterion (n=42, 71%) or at least three minor diagnostic criteria (n=15, 25%). In two patients, only two minor diagnostic criteria were detectable, insufficient for the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis. By the use of highly sensitive molecular methods, including the analysis of microdissected mast cells, KIT D816V was found in all 58 bone marrow biopsies investigated for it but only in 74% (20/27) of the skin biopsies. It is important to state that even in cases with insufficient diagnostic criteria for systemic mastocytosis, KIT D816V-positive mast cells were detected in the bone marrow. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that almost all patients with adult-onset mastocytosis in the skin, in fact, have systemic mastocytosis with cutaneous involvement.|Non-Cancer
ID:23921094|Title:Nonaggressive systemic mastocytosis (SM) without skin lesions associated with insect-induced anaphylaxis shows unique features versus other indolent SM.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) without skin lesions (ISMs(-)) shows a higher prevalence in males, lower serum baseline tryptase levels, and KIT mutation more frequently restricted to bone marrow (BM) mast cells (MCs) than ISM with skin lesions (ISMs(+)). Interestingly, in almost one-half of ISMs(-) patients, MC-mediator release episodes are triggered exclusively by insects. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the clinical and laboratory features of ISMs(-) associated with insect-induced anaphylaxis (insectISMs(-)) versus other patients with ISM. METHODS: A total of 335 patients presenting with MC activation syndrome, including 143 insectISMs(-), 72 ISMs(-) triggered by other factors (otherISMs(-)), 56 ISMs(+), and 64 nonclonal MC activation syndrome, were studied. RESULTS: Compared with otherISMs(-) and ISMs(+) patients, insectISMs(-) cases showed marked male predominance (78% vs 53% and 46%; P < .001), a distinct pattern of MC-related symptoms, and significantly lower median serum baseline tryptase levels (22.4 vs 28.7 and 45.8 mug/L; P <= .009). Moreover, insectISMs(-) less frequently presented BM MC aggregates (46% vs 70% and 81%; P <= .001), and they systematically showed MC-restricted KIT mutation. CONCLUSIONS: ISMs(-) patients with anaphylaxis triggered exclusively by insects display clinical and laboratory features that are significantly different from other ISM cases, including other ISMs(-) and ISMs(+) patients, suggesting that they represent a unique subgroup of ISM with a particularly low BM MC burden in the absence of adverse prognostic factors.|Non-Cancer

We assessed the association of psoriasis and its main clinical phenotypes with common variants of three potential psoriasis susceptibility genes: ZNF750, RPTOR and TRAF31P2. We genotyped 10 common variants in a cohort of 1,034 case-control individuals using Taqman genotyping assays and sequencing. Minor alleles of all four TRAF3IP2 variants were more frequent among cases. The strongest, significant association was observed for rs33980500 (OR = 2.5, p = 0.01790). Minor allele of this SNP was always present in two haplotypes found to be associated with increased psoriasis risk: rs13196377_G + rs13190932_G + rs33980500_T + rs13210247_A (OR = 2.7, p = 0.0054) and rs13196377_A + rs13190932_A + rs33980500_T + rs13210247_G (OR = 1.8, p = 0.0008). Analyses of clinically relevant phenotypes revealed association of rs33980500 with pustular psoriasis (OR = 1.2, p = 0.0109). We observed significant connection of severity of cutaneous disease with variation at rs13190932 and suggestive with three remaining TRAF3IP2 SNPs. Another positive associations were found between age of onset and familial aggregation of disease: smoking and younger age of onset, smoking and occurrence of pustular psoriasis, nail involvement and arthropatic psoriasis, nail involvement and more severe course of psoriasis. We found no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of the examined variants of RPTOR and ZNF750 genes among our cases and controls. We have replicated the association of TRAF3IP2-_rs33980500 variant with the susceptibility to psoriasis. We have found new associations with clinically relevant subphenotypes such as pustular psoriasis or moderate-to-severe cases. We ascertain no connection of RPTOR and ZNF750 variants with psoriasis or its subphenotypes.|Non-Cancer
ID:24075869|Title:Disruption of helix-capping residues 671 and 674 reveals a role in HIV-1 entry for a specialized hinge segment of the membrane proximal external region of gp41.Abstract:HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) uses its trimeric gp160 envelope (Env) protein consisting of non-covalently associated gp120 and gp41 subunits to mediate entry into human T lymphocytes. A facile virus fusion mechanism compensates for the sparse Env copy number observed on viral particles and includes a 22-amino-acid, lentivirus-specific adaptation at the gp41 base (amino acid residues 662-683), termed the membrane proximal external region (MPER). We show by NMR and EPR that the MPER consists of a structurally conserved pair of viral lipid-immersed helices separated by a hinge with tandem joints that can be locked by capping residues between helices. This design fosters efficient HIV-1 fusion via interconverting structures while, at the same time, affording immune escape. Disruption of both joints by double alanine mutations at Env positions 671 and 674 (AA) results in attenuation of Env-mediated cell-cell fusion and hemifusion, as well as viral infectivity mediated by both CD4-dependent and CD4-independent viruses. The potential mechanism of disruption was revealed by structural analysis of MPER conformational changes induced by AA mutation. A deeper acyl chain-buried MPER middle section and the elimination of cross-hinge rigid-body motion almost certainly impede requisite structural rearrangements during the fusion process, explaining the absence of MPER AA variants among all known naturally occurring HIV-1 viral sequences. Furthermore, those broadly neutralization antibodies directed against the HIV-1 MPER exploit the tandem joint architecture involving helix capping, thereby disrupting hinge function.|Non-Cancer
ID:24088119|Title:Lower lip pits: van der woude or kabuki syndrome?Abstract:Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome with characteristic facial features. Despite more than 350 documented cases and recent correlation of MLL2 mutations as a genetic cause, its full clinical spectrum is still being defined. This report describes two patients who were initially diagnosed with Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) based on the presence of lower lip pits. However, this finding can occur with KS, albeit infrequently. For patients with lower lip pits, a thorough evaluation should be made to distinguish between VWS and KS, as there are differences in long-term prognosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:24106199|Title:Striking hematological abnormalities in patients with microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II): a potential role of pericentrin in hematopoiesis.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II) is a rare primordial dwarfism that is similar to Seckel syndrome. Seckel syndrome is known to be associated with various hematological abnormalities; however, hematological findings in MOPD II patients have not been previously reported. The present study aimed to describe the hematological findings in a series of eight patients with MOPD II from a single center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included eight patients with MOPD II that were analyzed via molecular testing, and physical and laboratory examinations. RESULTS: Molecular testing showed that seven of the eight patients had pericentrin (PCNT) gene mutations. Hematological evaluation showed that 7 (87.5%) patients had thrombocytosis, 6 (75%) had leukocytosis, 5 (62.5%) had both leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, and 2 (25%) had anemia. CONCLUSIONS: We report leukocytosis and thrombocytosis as a common hematologic abnormality in patients with MOPD II. The present findings may improve our understanding of the potential function of the PCNT gene in hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation.|Non-Cancer
ID:24144875|Title:HLA-E restricted CD8+ T cell subsets are phenotypically altered in multiple sclerosis patients.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The importance of Qa-1 restricted CD8(+) T cells in regulating autoreactive T cell responses has been demonstrated in animal models for autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that their human variant, HLA-E restricted CD8(+) T cells, fulfills a similar regulatory role in man and that these cells are of importance in MS. METHODS: A large cohort of MS patients and healthy controls was genotyped for the two known HLA-E polymorphisms. Flow cytometry was used to determine HLA-E expression kinetics and to phenotype HLA-E restricted CD8(+) T cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate HLA-E expression in the central nervous system (CNS) of MS patients. RESULTS: HLA-E is upregulated on immune cells upon in vitro activation and this upregulation is polymorphism-dependent for T and B cells. T and B cells in lesions of MS patients show enhanced HLA-E expression. Furthermore, NKG2C(+)CD8(+) T cells of MS patients have a significantly lower Foxp3 expression, while NKG2A(+)CD8(+) T cells of MS patients produce higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to those of healthy individuals. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that the HLA-E system is altered in MS and could play a regulatory role in disease.|Non-Cancer
ID:24200965|Title:Dynamics of histone H3.3 deposition in proliferating and senescent cells reveals a DAXX-dependent targeting to PML-NBs important for pericentromeric heterochromatin organization.Abstract:Oncogene-induced senescence is a permanent cell cycle arrest characterized by extensive chromatin reorganization. Here, we investigated the specific targeting and dynamics of histone H3 variants in human primary senescent cells. We show that newly synthesized epitope-tagged H3.3 is incorporated in senescent cells but does not accumulate in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF). Instead, we observe that new H3.3 colocalizes with its specific histone chaperones within the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and is targeted to PML-NBs in a DAXX-dependent manner both in proliferating and senescent cells. We further show that overexpression of DAXX enhances targeting of H3.3 in large PML-NBs devoid of transcriptional activity and promotes the accumulation of HP1, independently of H3K9me3. Loss of H3.3 from pericentromeric heterochromatin upon DAXX or PML depletion suggests that the targeting of H3.3 to PML-NBs is implicated in pericentromeric heterochromatin organization. Together, our results underline the importance of the replication-independent chromatin assembly pathway for histone replacement in non-dividing senescent cells and establish PML-NBs as important regulatory sites for the incorporation of new H3.3 into chromatin.|Non-Cancer
ID:24201121|Title:Monoclonality and cytogenetic abnormalities in hyaline vascular Castleman disease.Abstract:Hyaline vascular Castleman disease is traditionally regarded as a reactive hyperplastic process. Occasional cases, however, have been reported with cytogenetic anomalies bringing this concept into question. In this study, we used conventional and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction methods to assess the human androgen receptor alpha (HUMARA) gene in 29 female patients with hyaline vascular Castleman disease and compared the results with three cases of plasma cell Castleman disease and 20 cases of age-matched lymphoid hyperplasia. We also assessed for immunoglobulin gene and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, and conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed in three cases of hyaline vascular Castleman disease. In cases with informative results, conventional and methylation-specific human androgen receptor alpha gene analyses yielded a monoclonal pattern in 10 of 19 (53%) and 17 of 23 (74%) cases of hyaline vascular Castleman disease, respectively. A monoclonal pattern was also detected in three cases of plasma cell Castleman disease but not in cases of lymphoid hyperplasia. The frequency of monoclonality was higher for lesions >5 cm in size (100%) and for the stromal-rich variant (91%). Cytogenetic abnormalities in stromal cells were revealed in two cases of hyaline vascular Castleman disease and no cases showed monoclonal immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. Follow-up data showed persistent disease in 4 of 23 (17%) patients. We conclude that hyaline vascular Castleman disease is often a monoclonal proliferation, most likely of lymph node stromal cells.|Non-Cancer
ID:24262698|Title:Mastocytosis.Abstract:Mastocytosis is a disorder of abnormal mast cell proliferation, with clinical features that include flushing, pruritus, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypotension, syncope, and musculoskeletal pain. These features are the result of mast cell mediator release and infiltration into target organs. Patients of all ages may be affected, although in children, manifestations primarily involve the skin. Most patients with systemic disease have a somatically acquired activating mutation in the KIT oncogene. This article discusses the causes and pathogenesis of mastocytosis, with an overview of the clinical features and the approach to diagnosis, evaluation, and therapy in adults and pediatric patients.|Non-Cancer

We report a Chinese family with indolent DCM, and detection of a new germline KIT mutation located in the fifth immunoglobulin-like loop of the KIT protein, which probably results in a gain-of-function effect and consequent overactivation of mast cells. Our report expands the knowledge of correlations between the genotype of KIT mutations and the phenotype of DCM.|Non-Cancer
ID:24291262|Title:Dynamic recruitment of active proteasomes into polyglutamine initiated inclusion bodies.Abstract:Neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease are hallmarked by neuronal intracellular inclusion body formation. Whether proteasomes are irreversibly recruited into inclusion bodies in these protein misfolding disorders is a controversial subject. In addition, it has been proposed that the proteasomes may become clogged by the aggregated protein fragments, leading to impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here, we show by fluorescence pulse-chase experiments in living cells that proteasomes are dynamically and reversibly recruited into inclusion bodies. As these recruited proteasomes remain catalytically active and accessible to substrates, our results challenge the concept of proteasome sequestration and impairment in Huntington's disease, and support the reported absence of proteasome impairment in mouse models of Huntington's disease.|Non-Cancer
ID:24374145|Title:Phase I evaluation of XL019, an oral, potent, and selective JAK2 inhibitor.Abstract:This phase I study evaluated selective JAK2 inhibitor XL019 in 30 patients with myelofibrosis. The initial dose cohorts were 100, 200, and 300 mg orally on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle. Central and/or peripheral neurotoxicity developed in all patients. Subsequently, patients were treated on lower doses; neurotoxicity was again observed, leading to study termination. Peripheral neuropathy resolved in 50%, and central neurotoxicity in all patients within months after therapy cessation. Myelosuppression was minimal. The terminal half-life of XL019 was approximately 21 h, with steady state reached by Day 8. International Working Group defined responses were seen in three (10%) patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:24389310|Title:SRSF2-p95 hotspot mutation is highly associated with advanced forms of mastocytosis and mutations in epigenetic regulator genes.Abstract:Mastocytosis is a rare and chronic disease with phenotypes ranging from indolent to severe. Prognosis for this disease is variable and very few biomarkers to predict disease evolution or outcome are currently known. We have performed comprehensive screening in our large cohort of mastocytosis patients for mutations previously found in other myeloid diseases and that could serve as prognostic indicators. KIT, SRSF2-P95 and TET2 mutations were by far the most frequent, detected in 81%, 24% and 21% of patients, respectively. Where TET2 and SRSF2-P95 mutation both correlated with advanced disease phenotypes, SRSF2-P95 hotspot mutation was found almost exclusively in patients diagnosed with associated clonal hematologic non-mast cell disease. Statistically, TET2 and SRSF2-P95 mutations were highly associated, suggesting a mechanistic link between these two factors. Finally, analysis of both clonal and sorted cell populations from patients confirms the presence of these mutations in the mast cell component of the disease, suggests an ontological mutation hierarchy and provides evidence for the expansion of multiple clones. This highlights the prognostic potential of such approaches, if applied systematically, for delineating the roles of specific mutations in predisposing and/or driving distinct disease phenotypes.|Non-Cancer
ID:24402730|Title:Benign mast cell hyperplasia and atypical mast cell infiltrates in penile lichen planus in adult men.Abstract:Introduction. Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic cytokine-mediated disease of possible auto-immune etiology. 25% of men have anogenital manifestations. Erosive penile LP causes a scarring phimosis of the foreskin in uncircumcised men. Mast cells as potent immune modulators have been implicated in a number of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, but have not been investigated in LP. Material and Methods. Formalin-fixed tissues of 117 circumcision specimens of adult men affected by LP were evaluated for the extent of mast cell and lymphocyte infiltrates, characterized immunohistochemically with antibodies to CD 3, 4, 8, 20, 21, 25, 30, 117c and human mast cell tryptase. Specimens with dense mast cell infiltrates were analyzed for point mutations of the c-kit gene (D816V). Results. Unaffected skin and modified mucosa of foreskins contained (5 mast cells/mm2. The inflammatory infiltrate of LP-lesions displayed (15 mast cells/mm2 in 33/117 foreskins, 16-40 mast cells/mm2 in 22/117 and )40 mast cells/mm2 (average 70, range 40-100) in 62/117 foreskins. Lesional mast cells of 29/117 (24%) foreskins showed aberrant CD25-expression and/or spindled morphology, with 11/29 men having erosive LP, 13/29 a lymphocytic vasculitis and 1/28 a systemic mastocytosis. Neither CD30-expression nor c-kit mutations were identified. Atypical mast cell infiltrates in LP correlated with high disease activity, erosive LP and presence of lymphocytic vasculitis Conclusions. Increased mast cells in penile LP, mostly representing a benign hyperplasia/activation syndrome, suggests them as targets for innovative therapy options for symptomatic LP-patients not responding to corticosteroid therapy. Presently, the biological implications of atypical mast cell infiltrates in penile LP are unknown.|Non-Cancer
ID:24418349|Title:Blood expression profiles of fragile X premutation carriers identify candidate genes involved in neurodegenerative and infertility phenotypes.Abstract:Male premutation carriers presenting between 55 and 200 CGG repeats in the Fragile-X-associated (FMR1) gene are at risk of developing Fragile X Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), and females undergo Premature Ovarian Failure (POF1). Here, we have evaluated gene expression profiles from blood in male FMR1 premutation carriers and detected a strong deregulation of genes enriched in FXTAS relevant biological pathways, including inflammation, neuronal homeostasis and viability. Gene expression profiling distinguished between control individuals, carriers with FXTAS and carriers without FXTAS, with levels of expanded FMR1 mRNA being increased in FXTAS patients. In vitro studies in a neuronal cell model indicate that expression levels of expanded FMR1 5'-UTR are relevant in modulating the transcriptome. Thus, perturbations of the transcriptome may be an interplay between the CGG expansion size and FMR1 expression levels. Several deregulated genes (DFFA, BCL2L11, BCL2L1, APP, SOD1, RNF10, HDAC5, KCNC3, ATXN7, ATXN3 and EAP1) were validated in brain samples of a FXTAS mouse model. Downregulation of EAP1, a gene involved in the female reproductive system physiology, was confirmed in female carriers. Decreased levels were detected in female carriers with POF1 compared to those without POF1, suggesting that EAP1 levels contribute to ovarian insufficiency. In summary, gene expression profiling in blood has uncovered mechanisms that may underlie different pathological aspects of the premutation. A better understanding of the transcriptome dynamics in relation with expanded FMR1 mRNA expression levels and CGG expansion size may provide mechanistic insights into the disease process and a more accurate FXTAS diagnosis to the myriad of phenotypes associated with the premutation.|Non-Cancer
ID:24443360|Title:Sensitive KIT D816V mutation analysis of blood as a diagnostic test in mastocytosis.Abstract:The recent progress in sensitive KIT D816V mutation analysis suggests that mutation analysis of peripheral blood (PB) represents a promising diagnostic test in mastocytosis. However, there is a need for systematic assessment of the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the approach in order to establish its value in clinical use. We therefore evaluated sensitive KIT D816V mutation analysis of PB as a diagnostic test in an entire case-series of adults with mastocytosis. We demonstrate for the first time that by using a sufficiently sensitive KIT D816V mutation analysis, it is possible to detect the mutation in PB in nearly all adult mastocytosis patients. The mutation was detected in PB in 78 of 83 systemic mastocytosis (94%) and 3 of 4 cutaneous mastocytosis patients (75%). The test was 100% specific as determined by analysis of clinically relevant control patients who all tested negative. Mutation analysis of PB was significantly more sensitive than serum tryptase >20 ng/mL. Of 27 patients with low tryptase, 26 tested mutation positive (96%). The test is furthermore readily available and we consider the results to serve as a foundation of experimental evidence to support the inclusion of the test in diagnostic algorithms and clinical practice in mastocytosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:24452316|Title:Variable clinical expressivity of STAT3 mutation in hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome: genetic and clinical studies of six patients.Abstract:BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Autosomal dominant Hyper IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) is a rare and complex primary immunodeficiency that affects multiple systems. Mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene cause AD-HIES. These mutations have a dominant-negative effect and the presence of such mutations is associated with a clinical phenotype. We aim to describe genetic and clinical characteristics of patients with AD-HIES in our clinic and to highlight the variability of clinical patterns in the same family. METHODS: We describe six patients, four individuals of the same family and two unrelated patients. All patients were given a clinical score based on disease phenotype according to the National Institute of Health (NIH) score. Mutation analysis of STAT3 was done by PCR amplification of all coding exons followed by bidirectional sequencing using the BigDye kit v1.1 and an ABI3700 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). RESULTS: All six patients had DNA binding region point mutations: a proband and his three children with p.Phe384Leu mutation, a patient with p.Arg382Trp substitution and a patient with p.Arg382Gln mutation. All of these mutations were previously reported. Patients differed in infectious, immunologic and somatic features. We observed an extreme variability in disease phenotype within the reported family with one genetically affected patient displaying an 'unaffected' phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Although the genetic cause of AD-HIES is known, more studies are required to better understand the possible additional factors that may affect disease expressivity within families and the clinical diversity of the disease.|Non-Cancer
ID:24475179|Title:Plakophilin-3 catenin associates with the ETV1/ER81 transcription factor to positively modulate gene activity.Abstract:Members of the plakophilin-catenin sub-family (Pkp-1, -2, and -3) facilitate the linkage of desmosome junctional components to each other (e.g. desmosomal cadherins to desmoplakin) and the intermediate-filament cytoskeleton. Pkps also contribute to desmosomal stabilization and the trafficking of its components. The functions of Pkps outside of the desmosome are less well studied, despite evidence suggesting their roles in mRNA regulation, small-GTPase modulation (e.g. mid-body scission) during cell division, and cell survival following DNA damage. Pkp-catenins are further believed to have roles in the nucleus given their nuclear localization in some contexts and the known nuclear roles of structurally related catenins, such as beta-catenin and p120-catenin. Further, Pkp-catenin activities in the nuclear compartment have become of increased interest with the identification of interactions between Pkp2-catenin and RNA Pol III and Pkp1 with single-stranded DNA. Consistent with earlier reports suggesting possible nuclear roles in development, we previously demonstrated prominent nuclear localization of Pkp3 in Xenopus naive ectoderm ("animal cap") cells and recently resolved a similar localization in mouse embryonic stem cells. Here, we report the association and positive functional interaction of Pkp3 with a transcription factor, Ets variant gene 1 (ETV1), which has critical roles in neural development and prominent roles in human genetic disease. Our results are the first to report the interaction of a sequence-specific transcription factor with any Pkp. Using Xenopus laevis embryos and mammalian cells, we provide evidence for the Pkp3:ETV1 complex on both biochemical and functional levels.|Non-Cancer
ID:24498434|Title:Structural and functional characterization of cargo-binding sites on the mu4-subunit of adaptor protein complex 4.Abstract:Adaptor protein (AP) complexes facilitate protein trafficking by playing key roles in the selection of cargo molecules to be sorted in post-Golgi compartments. Four AP complexes (AP-1 to AP-4) contain a medium-sized subunit (mu1-mu4) that recognizes YXXO-sequences (O is a bulky hydrophobic residue), which are sorting signals in transmembrane proteins. A conserved, canonical region in mu subunits mediates recognition of YXXO-signals by means of a critical aspartic acid. Recently we found that a non-canonical YXXO-signal on the cytosolic tail of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein (APP) binds to a distinct region of the mu4 subunit of the AP-4 complex. In this study we aimed to determine the functionality of both binding sites of mu4 on the recognition of the non-canonical YXXO-signal of APP. We found that substitutions in either binding site abrogated the interaction with the APP-tail in yeast-two hybrid experiments. Further characterization by isothermal titration calorimetry showed instead loss of binding to the APP signal with only the substitution R283D at the non-canonical site, in contrast to a decrease in binding affinity with the substitution D190A at the canonical site. We solved the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of the D190A mutant bound to this non-canonical YXXO-signal. This structure showed no significant difference compared to that of wild-type mu4. Both differential scanning fluorimetry and limited proteolysis analyses demonstrated that the D190A substitution rendered mu4 less stable, suggesting an explanation for its lower binding affinity to the APP signal. Finally, in contrast to overexpression of the D190A mutant, and acting in a dominant-negative manner, overexpression of mu4 with either a F255A or a R283D substitution at the non-canonical site halted APP transport at the Golgi apparatus. Together, our analyses support that the functional recognition of the non-canonical YXXO-signal of APP is limited to the non-canonical site of mu4.|Non-Cancer

ID:24522987|Title:The impact of molecular testing on the surgical management of patients with thyroid nodules.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The use of molecular tests as an adjunct to FNA diagnosis of thyroid nodules has been increasing. However, the true impact of these tests on surgical practice has not been demonstrated. This study examines the usefulness of molecular testing on surgical management decisions in patients referred for thyroid surgery at a tertiary care center. METHODS: Clinical information was collected from patients who presented to Johns Hopkins Hospital for surgical consultation regarding a thyroid nodule and who underwent molecular testing between August 2009 and March 2013. Tests included an RNA-based gene expression classifier, a DNA-based somatic mutation panel, BRAF, NRAS, and/or RET/PTC translocation. A surgical management algorithm was created by consensus of four thyroid surgeons. Postsurgical pathology analysis in each case was then used to judge the appropriateness of the surgical decision-making and the usefulness of preoperative molecular testing, in guiding surgical planning. RESULTS: Of 114 patients assessed by preoperative molecular testing, 87 (72 %) underwent surgery. Surgical management was altered in nine (10 %) patients on the basis of molecular testing. Of these, surgical management change was appropriate, relative to the postoperative pathology analysis, for three patients and inappropriate for six patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, molecular testing of thyroid nodule did not alter the surgical management of the majority of patients with thyroid nodules. These results indicate that molecular testing may be overused in patients for whom the results would not change surgical management. Furthermore, our data question the usefulness of the molecular tests examined in guiding preoperative surgical decision-making.|Non-Cancer

ID:24558502|Title:Fibrous papule of the face, similar to tuberous sclerosis complex-associated angiofibroma, shows activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway: evidence for a novel therapeutic strategy?Abstract:Fibrous papules of the face are hamartomas characterized by stellate-shaped stromal cells, multinucleated giant cells, and proliferative blood vessels in the dermis. The pathogenesis of fibrous papules remains unclear. There is a striking microscopic resemblance between fibrous papules and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated angiofibromas. A germline mutation of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, leading to activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, accounts for the pathogenesis of TSC-associated angiofibromas. Activated mTOR subsequently activates p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and ribosomal protein S6 (S6) by phosphorylation. Rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, is effective in treating TSC-associated angiofibromas. The aim of this study was to understand whether the mTOR pathway is activated in fibrous papules. We studied immunoexpressions of phosphorylated (p-) mTOR effectors in fibrous papules, TSC-associated angiofibromas, and normal skin controls. P-mTOR, p-p70S6K and p-S6 were highly expressed in dermal stromal cells and epidermal keratinocytes in fibrous papules and TSC-associated angiofibromas but not in fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes of normal skin controls (p<0.001). The results suggest topical rapamycin may be a novel treatment option for fibrous papules.|Non-Cancer
ID:24601692|Title:Macronodular adrenal hyperplasia due to mutations in an armadillo repeat containing 5 (ARMC5) gene: a clinical and genetic investigation.Abstract:CONTEXT: Inactivating germline mutations of the probable tumor suppressor gene, armadillo repeat containing 5 (ARMC5), have recently been identified as a genetic cause of macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (MAH). OBJECTIVE: We searched for ARMC5 mutations in a large cohort of patients with MAH. The clinical phenotype of patients with and without ARMC5 mutations was compared. METHODS: Blood DNA from 34 MAH patients was genotyped using Sanger sequencing. Diurnal serum cortisol measurements, plasma ACTH levels, urinary steroids, 6-day Liddle's test, adrenal computed tomography, and weight of adrenal glands at adrenalectomy were assessed. RESULTS: Germline ARMC5 mutations were found in 15 of 34 patients (44.1%). In silico analysis of the mutations indicated that seven (20.6%) predicted major implications for gene function. Late-night cortisol levels were higher in patients with ARMC5-damaging mutations compared with those without and/or with nonpathogenic mutations (14.5 +- 5.6 vs 6.7 +- 4.3, P < .001). All patients carrying a pathogenic ARMC5 mutation had clinical Cushing's syndrome (seven of seven, 100%) compared with 14 of 27 (52%) of those without or with mutations that were predicted to be benign (P = .029). Repeated-measures analysis showed overall higher urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and free cortisol values in the patients with ARMC5-damaging mutations during the 6-day Liddle's test (P = .0002). CONCLUSIONS: ARMC5 mutations are implicated in clinically severe Cushing's syndrome associated with MAH. Knowledge of a patient's ARMC5 status has important clinical implications for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome and genetic counseling of patients and their families.|Non-Cancer

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Tertiary center for cochlear and auditory brainstem implantation. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients (10 ABI, 3CI) with NF2 underwent a total of 76 MRI scans. INTERVENTIONS: MRI without magnet removal. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Ability to visualize the ipsilateral and contralateral cerebellopontine angles (CPAs) and internal auditory meati (IAM) with head MRI. RESULTS: Of the 76 scans, 40 were of the head, 28 of the spine and 8 of other regions. Scanning was performed with a tight head bandage and plastic card. There were no cases of altered implant function or demagnetization of the device magnet.A grading system was used to assess the view of the ipsilateral IAM-CPA. In 85% of head scans, the view was unimpaired (Grade 0). In 13%, there was distortion (Grade 1). In 2% (1 case), the view was entirely obscured by artifact (Grade 2). Views of the contralateral CPA and IAM were unimpaired in all cases. The best 3 sequences for the depiction of the ipsilateral IAM-CPA (percent graded as 0) were as follows: axial 3D inversion recovery prepared fast spoiled gradient echo (100%), 2 mm coronal T1W of the IAM-CPA (88.9%), and 2 mm axial T1W of the IAM-CPA (76.9%). CONCLUSION: MRI scanning without magnet removal is safe and well tolerated in NF2 patients with auditory implants. With appropriate MRI sequences, the image quality is not significantly impaired.|Non-Cancer
ID:24616478|Title:Metabolic reprogramming is required for antibody production that is suppressed in anergic but exaggerated in chronically BAFF-exposed B cells.Abstract:B cell activation leads to proliferation and Ab production that can protect from pathogens or promote autoimmunity. Regulation of cell metabolism is essential to support the demands of lymphocyte growth and effector function and may regulate tolerance. In this study, we tested the regulation and role of glucose uptake and metabolism in the proliferation and Ab production of control, anergic, and autoimmune-prone B cells. Control B cells had a balanced increase in lactate production and oxygen consumption following activation, with proportionally increased glucose transporter Glut1 expression and mitochondrial mass upon either LPS or BCR stimulation. This contrasted with metabolic reprogramming of T cells, which had lower glycolytic flux when resting but disproportionately increased this pathway upon activation. Importantly, tolerance greatly affected B cell metabolic reprogramming. Anergic B cells remained metabolically quiescent, with only a modest increase in glycolysis and oxygen consumption with LPS stimulation. B cells chronically stimulated with elevated BAFF, however, rapidly increased glycolysis and Ab production upon stimulation. Induction of glycolysis was critical for Ab production, as glycolytic inhibition with the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor dichloroacetate sharply suppressed B cell proliferation and Ab secretion in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, B cell-specific deletion of Glut1 led to reduced B cell numbers and impaired Ab production in vivo. Together, these data show that activated B cells require Glut1-dependent metabolic reprogramming to support proliferation and Ab production that is distinct from T cells and that this glycolytic reprogramming is regulated in tolerance.|Non-Cancer
ID:24626649|Title:Adult mastocytosis: a review of the Santo Antonio Hospital 's experience and an evaluation of World Health Organization criteria for the diagnosis of systemic disease.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is a clonal disorder characterized by the accumulation of abnormal mast cells in the skin and/or in extracutaneous organs. OBJECTIVES: To present all cases of mastocytosis seen in the Porto Hospital Center and evaluate the performance of World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for systemic disease. METHODS: The cases of twenty-four adult patients with mastocytosis were reviewed. Their clinical and laboratorial characteristics were assessed, and the properties of the criteria used to diagnose systemic mastocytosis were evaluated. RESULTS: The age of disease onset ranged from 2 to 75 years. Twenty-three patients had cutaneous involvement and 75% were referred by dermatologists. Urticaria pigmentosa was the most common manifestation of the disease. One patient with severe systemic mast cell mediator-related symptoms showed the activating V560G KIT mutation. The bone marrow was examined in 79% of patients, and mast cell immunophenotyping was performed in 67% of the participants. Systemic disease was detected in 84% of cases, and 81% of the sample had elevated serum tryptase levels. All the diagnostic criteria for systemic mastocytosis had high specificity and positive predictive value. Bone marrow biopsy had the lowest sensitivity, negative predictive value and efficiency, while the highest such values were observed for mast cell immunophenotyping. Patients were treated with regimens including antihistamines, sodium cromoglycate, alpha-interferon, hydroxyurea and phototherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous involvement is often seen in adult mastocytosis patients, with most individuals presenting with indolent systemic disease. Although serum tryptase levels are a good indicator of mast cell burden, bone marrow biopsy should also be performed in patients with normal serum tryptase, with flow cytometry being the most adequate method to diagnose systemic disease.|Non-Cancer
ID:24647736|Title:Multiple nonglycemic genomic loci are newly associated with blood level of glycated hemoglobin in East Asians.Abstract:Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is used as a measure of glycemic control and also as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. To discover novel loci harboring common variants associated with HbA1c in East Asians, we conducted a meta-analysis of 13 genome-wide association studies (GWAS; N = 21,026). We replicated our findings in three additional studies comprising 11,576 individuals of East Asian ancestry. Ten variants showed associations that reached genome-wide significance in the discovery data set, of which nine (four novel variants at TMEM79 [P value = 1.3 x 10(-23)], HBS1L/MYB [8.5 x 10(-15)], MYO9B [9.0 x 10(-12)], and CYBA [1.1 x 10(-8)] as well as five variants at loci that had been previously identified [CDKAL1, G6PC2/ABCB11, GCK, ANK1, and FN3KI]) showed consistent evidence of association in replication data sets. These variants explained 1.76% of the variance in HbA1c. Several of these variants (TMEM79, HBS1L/MYB, CYBA, MYO9B, ANK1, and FN3K) showed no association with either blood glucose or type 2 diabetes. Among individuals with nondiabetic levels of fasting glucose (<7.0 mmol/L) but elevated HbA1c (>=6.5%), 36.1% had HbA1c <6.5% after adjustment for these six variants. Our East Asian GWAS meta-analysis has identified novel variants associated with HbA1c as well as demonstrated that the effects of known variants are largely transferable across ethnic groups. Variants affecting erythrocyte parameters rather than glucose metabolism may be relevant to the use of HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes in these populations.|Non-Cancer
ID:24676424|Title:Neurofibromatosis type 1 gene mutation analysis using sequence capture and high-throughput sequencing.Abstract:Neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome (NF1) is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. Availability of new sequencing technology prompted us to search for an alternative method for NF1 mutation analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from saliva avoiding invasive sampling. The NF1 exons with an additional 50bp of flanking intronic sequences were captured and enriched using the SeqCap EZ Choice Library protocol. The captured DNA was sequenced with the Roche/454 GS Junior system. The mean coverages of the targeted regions were 41x and 74x in 2 separate sets of samples. An NF1 mutation was discovered in 10 out of 16 separate patient samples. Our study provides proof of principle that the sequence capture methodology combined with high-throughput sequencing is applicable to NF1 mutation analysis. Deep intronic mutations may however remain undetectable, and change at the DNA level may not predict the outcome at the mRNA or protein levels.|Non-Cancer
ID:24676943|Title:Fast and robust next-generation sequencing technique using ion torrent personal genome machine for the screening of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene.Abstract:Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene exhibits one of the highest spontaneous mutation rates in the human genome. Identification of the NF1 mutation is challenging because the NF1 gene is very large and complex, lacking mutational "hot spots." There is no clustering of mutations, there are several pseudogenes, and a wide spectrum of different types of mutation has been recognized. To date, NF1 mutations or deleted regions have been detected with a number of techniques. With the appearance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) machines, molecular biology is in a new revolutionary phase. Our aim was to work out a method to use the high-throughput NGS machine, Ion Torrent PGM, in diagnostic settings for neurofibromatosis type 1. In our examination, we could reveal 21 distinct variations in NF1 gene in seven patients. This is an absolutely new method for exploring the genetic background of neurofibromatosis type 1 exhibiting the extremely high throughput of NGS in a diagnostic setting.|Non-Cancer
ID:24688314|Title:Comparison of methods for the extraction of DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues.Abstract:AIM: Discussing a protocol involving xylene-ethanol deparaffinization on slides followed by a kit-based extraction that allows for the extraction of high quality DNA from FFPE tissues. METHODS: DNA was extracted from the FFPE tissues of 16 randomly selected blocks. Methods involving deparaffinization on slides or tubes, enzyme digestion overnight or for 72 hours and isolation using phenol chloroform method or a silica-based commercial kit were compared in terms of yields, concentrations and the amplifiability. RESULTS: The highest yield of DNA was produced from the samples that were deparaffinized on slides, digested for 72 hours and isolated with a commercial kit. Samples isolated with the phenol-chloroform method produced DNA of lower purity than the samples that were purified with kit. The samples isolated with the commercial kit resulted in better PCR amplification. CONCLUSION: Silica-based commercial kits and deparaffinized on slides should be considered for DNA extraction from FFPE.|Non-Cancer
ID:24690944|Title:Massively parallel sequencing of patients with intellectual disability, congenital anomalies and/or autism spectrum disorders with a targeted gene panel.Abstract:Developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (DD/ID) affects 1-3% of all children. At least half of these are thought to have a genetic etiology. Recent studies have shown that massively parallel sequencing (MPS) using a targeted gene panel is particularly suited for diagnostic testing for genetically heterogeneous conditions. We report on our experiences with using massively parallel sequencing of a targeted gene panel of 355 genes for investigating the genetic etiology of eight patients with a wide range of phenotypes including DD/ID, congenital anomalies and/or autism spectrum disorder. Targeted sequence enrichment was performed using the Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment Kit and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000 using paired-end reads. For all eight patients, 81-84% of the targeted regions achieved read depths of at least 20x, with average read depths overlapping targets ranging from 322x to 798x. Causative variants were successfully identified in two of the eight patients: a nonsense mutation in the ATRX gene and a canonical splice site mutation in the L1CAM gene. In a third patient, a canonical splice site variant in the USP9X gene could likely explain all or some of her clinical phenotypes. These results confirm the value of targeted MPS for investigating DD/ID in children for diagnostic purposes. However, targeted gene MPS was less likely to provide a genetic diagnosis for children whose phenotype includes autism.|Non-Cancer
ID:24694135|Title:Computing global minimizers to a constrained B-spline image registration problem from optimal l1 perturbations to block match data.Abstract:PURPOSE: Block matching is a well-known strategy for estimating corresponding voxel locations between a pair of images according to an image similarity metric. Though robust to issues such as image noise and large magnitude voxel displacements, the estimated point matches are not guaranteed to be spatially accurate. However, the underlying optimization problem solved by the block matching procedure is similar in structure to the class of optimization problem associated with B-spline based registration methods. By exploiting this relationship, the authors derive a numerical method for computing a global minimizer to a constrained B-spline registration problem that incorporates the robustness of block matching with the global smoothness properties inherent to B-spline parameterization. METHODS: The method reformulates the traditional B-spline registration problem as a basis pursuit problem describing the minimall1-perturbation to block match pairs required to produce a B-spline fitting error within a given tolerance. The sparsity pattern of the optimal perturbation then defines a voxel point cloud subset on which the B-spline fit is a global minimizer to a constrained variant of the B-spline registration problem. As opposed to traditional B-spline algorithms, the optimization step involving the actual image data is addressed by block matching. RESULTS: The performance of the method is measured in terms of spatial accuracy using ten inhale/exhale thoracic CT image pairs (available for download atwww.dir-lab.com) obtained from the COPDgene dataset and corresponding sets of expert-determined landmark point pairs. The results of the validation procedure demonstrate that the method can achieve a high spatial accuracy on a significantly complex image set. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed methodology is demonstrated to achieve a high spatial accuracy and is generalizable in that in can employ any displacement field parameterization described as a least squares fit to block match generated estimates. Thus, the framework allows for a wide range of image similarity block match metric and physical modeling combinations.|Non-Cancer

ID:24718618|Title:Rapid and efficient conversion of integration-free human induced pluripotent stem cells to GMP-grade culture conditions.Abstract:Data suggest that clinical applications of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) will be realized. Nonetheless, clinical applications will require hiPSCs that are free of exogenous DNA and that can be manufactured through Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Optimally, derivation of hiPSCs should be rapid and efficient in order to minimize manipulations, reduce potential for accumulation of mutations and minimize financial costs. Previous studies reported the use of modified synthetic mRNAs to reprogram fibroblasts to a pluripotent state. Here, we provide an optimized, fully chemically defined and feeder-free protocol for the derivation of hiPSCs using synthetic mRNAs. The protocol results in derivation of fully reprogrammed hiPSC lines from adult dermal fibroblasts in less than two weeks. The hiPSC lines were successfully tested for their identity, purity, stability and safety at a GMP facility and cryopreserved. To our knowledge, as a proof of principle, these are the first integration-free iPSCs lines that were reproducibly generated through synthetic mRNA reprogramming that could be putatively used for clinical purposes.|Non-Cancer
ID:24744588|Title:HLA variants related to primary sclerosing cholangitis influence rejection after liver transplantation.Abstract:AIM: To investigate influence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer immunoglobuline-like receptor (KIR) genotypes on risks of acute rejection (AR) after liver transplantation (LTX). METHODS: In this retrospective study we included 143 adult donor-recipient pairs with a minimum of 6 mo follow-up after LTX for whom DNA was available from both donor and recipients. Clinical data, all early complications including episodes and severity of AR and graft/patient survival were registered. The diagnosis of AR was based on clinical, biochemical and histological criteria. All suspected episodes of AR were biopsy confirmed. Key classical HLA loci (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-DRB1) were genotyped using Sanger sequencing. 16 KIR genes were genotyped using a novel real time PCR approach which allows for determination of the diploid copy number of each KIR gene. Immunohistochemical staining for T (CD3), B (CD20) and natural killer (NK) cells (CD56 and CD57) were performed on liver biopsies from 3 different patient groups [primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cirrhosis and non-autoimmune liver disease], 10 in each group, with similar grade of AR. RESULTS: Fourty-four (31%) patients were transplanted on the basis of PSC, 40% of them had AR vs 24% in the non-PSC group (P = 0.04). No significant impact of donor-recipient matching for HLA and KIR genotypes was detected. In the overall recipient population an increased risk of AR was detected for HLA-B*08 (P = 0.002, OR = 2.5; 95%CI: 1.4-4.6), HLA-C*07 (P = 0.001, OR = 2.4; 95%CI: 1.4-4.0) and HLA-DRB1*03 (P = 0.03, OR = 1.9; 95%CI: 1.0-3.3) and a decreased risk for HLA-DRB1*04 (P = 0.001, OR = 0.2; 95%CI: 0.1-0.5). For HLA-B*08, HLA-C*07 and DRB1*04 the associations remained evident in a subgroup analysis of non-PSC recipients (P = 0.04, P = 0.003 and P = 0.02, respectively). In PSC recipients corresponding P values were 0.002, 0.17 and 0.01 for HLA-B*08, HLA-C*07 and DRB1*04, respectively. A dosage effect of AR prevalence according to the PSC associated HLA alleles was also notable in the total recipient population. For HLA-B*08 the frequency of AR was 56% in HLA-B*08 homozygous recipients, 39% in heterozygous recipients and 21% in recipients lacking HLA-B*08 (P = 0.02). The same was observed for the HLA-C*07 allele with AR in 57%, 27% and 18% in recipients being homozygous, heterozygous and lacking HLA-C*07 respectively (P = 0.003). Immunohistochemical analysis showed similar infiltration of T, B and NK cells in biopsies with AR in all three groups. CONCLUSION: We found significant associations between the PSC-associated HLA-B*08, HLA-C*07, HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*04 alleles and risk of AR in liver transplant recipients.|Non-Cancer
ID:24745670|Title:Diagnostic criteria and classification of mastocytosis in 2014.Abstract:Mastocytosis is characterized by accumulation of pathologic mast cells in tissues. Most patients with mastocytosis experience mast cell activation symptoms in response to various triggers. The diagnosis of mastocytosis should be made from objective pathologic findings. Modern diagnostic criteria and classification of mastocytosis were proposed in 2000 by an international consensus group and formed the basis of the current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which have been validated to correlate with prognosis and help selection of therapy. In this article, the WHO criteria for diagnosis and classification are summarized and practical aspects to avoid common pitfalls in diagnostic workup are discussed.|Non-Cancer

ID:24745676|Title:Mastocytosis: immunophenotypical features of the transformed mast cells are unique among hematopoietic cells.Abstract:Mastocytosis is a disease of bone marrow origin histologically characterized by compact tissue infiltrates of atypical mast cells never seen in reactive states. Most patients with mastocytosis have transformed mast cells carrying an activating point mutation at codon 816 of KIT and also show an elevated serum tryptase level. In this article immunophenotypical features of mast cells are described. Based on these features, mast cells are not closely related to other myeloid cells. Using the knowledge on aberrantly expressed antigens by mast cells, the hematopathologist should be able to recognize the disease even in the presence of unusual morphologic findings or an associated hematologic non-mast cell lineage disease.|Non-Cancer
ID:24745677|Title:Pathology of extramedullary mastocytosis.Abstract:Mastocytosis encompasses a group of clinically and pathologically heterogeneous disorders most commonly involving the skin, which typically takes the form of urticaria pigmentosa. Mastocytosis may also involve other organs, most often bone marrow, followed by gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. The presence of extracutaneous involvement by mastocytosis is a major diagnostic criterion for systemic disease. However, mast cell infiltrates are often subtle in skin and extracutaneous organs, and the histologic features of mastocytosis at different anatomic sites may be variable. This article reviews the pathologic features and clinical correlates of mastocytosis involving skin and other extramedullary sites.|Non-Cancer
ID:24750133|Title:The KIT D816V allele burden predicts survival in patients with mastocytosis and correlates with the WHO type of the disease.Abstract:KIT D816V is present in a majority of patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM). We determined the KIT D816V allele burden by quantitative real-time PCR in bone marrow and peripheral blood of 105 patients with mastocytosis. KIT D816V was detected in 92/105 patients (88%). Significant differences in the median allele burden were observed between disease subgroups: cutaneous mastocytosis (0.042%), indolent SM (0.285%), smoldering SM (5.991%), aggressive SM (9.346%), and SM with associated hematologic non-mast cell lineage disease (3.761%) (P < 0.001). The KIT D816V burden also correlated with serum tryptase (R = 0.5, P < 0.005) but not with mast cell infiltration in bone marrow or mediator symptoms. Moreover, the allele burden was of prognostic significance regarding survival (P < 0.01). Patients responding to cytoreductive therapy showed a significant decrease in KIT D816V (P < 0.05). To conclude, the KIT D816V burden correlates with the variant of mastocytosis, predicts survival, and is a valuable follow-up parameter in SM.|Non-Cancer

ID:24767283|Title:LEOPARD syndrome: clinical dilemmas in differential diagnosis of RASopathies.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Diagnosis within RASopathies still represents a challenge. Nevertheless, many efforts have been made by clinicians to identify specific clinical features which might help in differentiating one disorder from another. Here, we describe a child initially diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome. The follow-up of the proband, the clinical evaluation of his father together with a gene-by-gene testing approach led us to the proper diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 8-year-old male with multiple cafe-au-lait macules, several lentigines and dysmorphic features that suggest Noonan syndrome initially diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome. However, after a few years of clinical and ophthalmological follow-up, the absence of typical features of Neurofibromatosis type 1 and the lack of NF1 mutation led us to reconsider the original diagnosis. A new examination of the patient and his similarly affected father, who was initially referred as healthy, led us to suspect LEOPARD syndrome, The diagnosis was then confirmed by the occurrence in both patients of a heterozygous mutation c.1403 C > T, p.(Thr468Met), of PTPN11. Subsequently, the proband was also found to have type-1 Arnold-Chiari malformation in association with syringomyelia. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that differential clinical diagnosis among RASopathies remains ambiguous and raises doubts on the current diagnostic clinical criteria. In some cases, genetic tests represent the only conclusive proof for a correct diagnosis and, consequently, for establishing individual prognosis and providing adequate follow-up. Thus, molecular testing represents an essential tool in differential diagnosis of RASophaties. This view is further strengthened by the increasing accessibility of new sequencing techniques.Finally, to our knowledge, the described case represents the third report of the occurrence of Arnold Chiari malformation and the second description of syringomyelia with LEOPARD syndrome.|Non-Cancer
ID:24777453|Title:Rare and low-frequency coding variants in CXCR2 and other genes are associated with hematological traits.Abstract:Hematological traits are important clinical parameters. To test the effects of rare and low-frequency coding variants on hematological traits, we analyzed hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit levels, white blood cell (WBC) counts and platelet counts in 31,340 individuals genotyped on an exome array. We identified several missense variants in CXCR2 associated with reduced WBC count (gene-based P = 2.6 x 10(-13)). In a separate family-based resequencing study, we identified a CXCR2 frameshift mutation in a pedigree with congenital neutropenia that abolished ligand-induced CXCR2 signal transduction and chemotaxis. We also identified missense or splice-site variants in key hematopoiesis regulators (EPO, TFR2, HBB, TUBB1 and SH2B3) associated with blood cell traits. Finally, we were able to detect associations between a rare somatic JAK2 mutation (encoding p.Val617Phe) and platelet count (P = 3.9 x 10(-22)) as well as hemoglobin concentration (P = 0.002), hematocrit levels (P = 9.5 x 10(-7)) and WBC count (P = 3.1 x 10(-5)). In conclusion, exome arrays complement genome-wide association studies in identifying new variants that contribute to complex human traits.|Non-Cancer
ID:24780089|Title:New molecular diagnostic kit to assess Y-chromosome deletions in the Japanese population.Abstract:OBJECTIVES: Deletions in the azoospermia factor regions are the most common known molecular genetic cause of human male infertility involving spermatogenetic failure. Testing for these deletions in Japanese DNA samples using conventional sequence-tagged site probes occasionally lead to considerable non-specific or faint products in the Japanese population. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a newly developed kit for the detection of azoospermia factor microdeletions in the Japanese population. METHODS: Sequence-tagged site probes were reselected and the Luminex suspension array assay was carried out. Validation was retrospectively carried out with 2014 DNA sequences with known microdeletions, which were divided into four categories. RESULTS: Category 1 deletions that corresponded to the conventional classification of azoospermia factor deletion were present in 83 men (4.2%), which can result in intrachromosomal homologous recombination. Kit data confirmed the presence of deletions of this type in DNA sequences known to harbor the azoospermia factor deletions. Category 2 deletions involved cytogenetic abnormalities in 28 men (1.4%), whereas category 3 deletions in 759 men (37.7%) were atypical classifications including the gr/gr deletion. As these deletions are thought to be a result of palindromic units and non-homologous recombination, these microdeletions might impact in the interpretation of some clinical findings. The rest of the 1145 cases (56.8%) were assigned to category 4 as normal variants (polymorphism/no deletion). CONCLUSIONS: The present findings show that this new kit offers good sensitivity and specificity with the advantage of saving in terms of cost and time.|Non-Cancer
ID:24789688|Title:Fifty-four novel mutations in the NF1 gene and integrated analyses of the mutations that modulate splicing.Abstract:Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. One of the hallmarks of NF1 is the high mutation rate in this gene. In this study, we present 127 different NF1 mutations and 54 novel mutations detected at both the genomic DNA and mRNA level using a retrospective case series review. We found that 25.2% of these different mutations induced aberrant splicing. Of note, 40.6% of these splicing errors were caused by exonic variants. In addition, one mutation produced mosaicism in the post-transcriptional profile. However, studies investigating these splicing aberrations are limited. In order to better understand the pathogenicity of NF1 and to provide a more accurate interpretation in molecular diagnostic testing, combined computational analyses were employed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the variants modulating NF1 gene splicing.|Non-Cancer
ID:24795088|Title:High-quality DNA from fingernails for genetic analysis.Abstract:The availability of high-quality germline DNA is an important prerequisite for a variety of genetic analyses. We have shown previously that fingernail clippings provide an optimal source of autologous, constitutional DNA for PCR-based applications. However, most existing protocols for nucleic acid purification from nails do not provide sufficiently high yields of pure and intact DNA for more demanding downstream analyses such as next generation sequencing (NGS). We have extensively tested and systematically modified a number of different protocols for DNA purification from nail material to optimize the yield and quality. The integrity of DNA was determined by PCR amplification of short (<300 bp), mid-range (>400 bp), and long-range (>2 kb) sequences using different target genes. Among the methods tested, the Prepfiler Forensic DNA Extraction kit was identified as the most appropriate approach to isolation of high-quality DNA from nail clippings. A standardized input of 20 mg nail material (1 to 10 pieces of fingernail clippings) yielded a mean of 1 mug DNA (range, 0.5 to 2.3 mug). Subsequent PCR-analysis revealed efficient amplifiability of short and mid-range targets in 93% and 90%, and long-range fragments in 60% of the samples tested. The adequacy for next generation sequencing applications was demonstrated by successful high-resolution HLA-typing in ten transplant recipients. Hence, the protocol presented facilitates the exploitation of fingernail material even for demanding genomic analyses both in research and diagnostics.|Non-Cancer
ID:24806963|Title:Peptide-independent stabilization of MHC class I molecules breaches cellular quality control.Abstract:The intracellular trafficking of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) proteins is directed by three quality control mechanisms that test for their structural integrity, which is correlated to the binding of high-affinity antigenic peptide ligands. To investigate which molecular features of MHC-I these quality control mechanisms detect, we have followed the hypothesis that suboptimally loaded MHC-I molecules are characterized by their conformational mobility in the F-pocket region of the peptide-binding site. We have created a novel variant of an MHC-I protein, K(b)-Y84C, in which two alpha-helices in this region are linked by a disulfide bond that mimics the conformational and dynamic effects of bound high-affinity peptide. K(b)-Y84C shows a remarkable increase in the binding affinity to its light chain, beta-2 microglobulin (beta2m), and bypasses all three cellular quality control steps. Our data demonstrate (1) that coupling between peptide and beta2m binding to the MHC-I heavy chain is mediated by conformational dynamics; (2) that the folded conformation of MHC-I, supported by beta2m, plays a decisive role in passing the ER-to-cell-surface transport quality controls; and (3) that beta2m association is also tested by the cell surface quality control that leads to MHC-I endocytosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:24807696|Title:Novel mechanism of transcriptional repression of the human ATP binding cassette transporter A1 gene in hepatic cells by the winged helix/forkhead box transcription factor A2.Abstract:ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays a key role in the biogenesis of HDL by promoting the efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid free apoA-I. Mutations in the ABCA1 gene cause Tangier disease which is characterized by near or complete absence of circulating plasma HDL. In the present study we show that the winged helix/forkhead box containing transcription factor A2 (FOXA2) shown previously to play a role in glucose and bile acid homeostasis in the liver and in energy utilization in adipose tissue is a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells. We show that the ABCA1 promoter contains three FOXA2 binding elements in the proximal region. Two of the sites are localized in a region of the ABCA1 promoter enriched in binding elements for transcriptional repressor proteins whereas the third site is the core of the TATA element of the ABCA1 promoter. Inhibition of FOXA2 binding to the ABCA1 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis or FOXA2 gene expression by siRNA was associated with increased ABCA1 promoter activity and protein levels. Overexpression of FOXA2 inhibited both the constitutive ABCA1 gene expression as well as ABCA1 gene induction by oxysterols and retinoids via nuclear receptors LXRalpha/RXRalpha. In summary, the present study identifies transcription factor FOXA2 as a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells and reveals a novel mechanism of transcriptional repression by FOXA2 which involves the TATA element of the ABCA1 gene.|Non-Cancer
ID:24815379|Title:Application of COLD-PCR for improved detection of NF2 mosaic mutations.Abstract:Somatic mosaicism represents the coexistence of two or more cell populations with different genotypes in one person, and it is involved in >30 monogenic disorders. Somatic mosaicism characterizes approximately 25% to 33% of patients with de novo neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The identification of mosaicism is crucial to patients and their families because the clinical course of the disease and its transmission risk is influenced by the degree and distribution of mutated cells. Moreover, in NF2, the capability of discriminating patients with mosaicism is especially important to make differential diagnosis with schwannomatosis. However, the identification of mosaic variants is considerably difficult, and the development of specific molecular techniques to detect low levels of unknown molecular alterations is required. Co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature (COLD)-PCR has been described as a powerful method to selectively amplify minority alleles from mixtures of wild-type and mutation-containing sequences. Here, we applied COLD-PCR to molecular analysis of patients with NF2 mosaicism. With the use of COLD-PCR, followed by direct sequencing, we were able to detect NF2 mutations in blood DNA of three patients with NF2 mosaicism. Our study has shown the capability of COLD-PCR in enriching low-represented mutated allele in blood DNA sample, making it usable for molecular diagnosis of patients with mosaicism.|Non-Cancer
ID:24819622|Title:Surgical treatment of lumbosacral pseudarthrosis and spondyloptosis in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 and a large lumbar anterior meningocele. Case report and review of the literature.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Lumbar anterior meningocele (MC) is rare in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Although spinal fusion with maximum possible resection of the cele might be indicated in these special cases, reports describing operative procedures are lacking. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present a young woman with NF1 and lower back pain due to lumbar anterior MC, extensive osteolysis, and deformation of the lumbar spine. After Harrington spondylodesis from T12 to S1 in 1989, she developed lumbosacral pseudarthrosis and transcutaneous migration of the spondylodesis. Thus the left pole of the spondylodesis was shortened below the level of L5 in 2005. Years later, the patient presented with lower back pain and wound infection. Imaging revealed the MC and avulsion of the right S1 screw with lumbosacral pseudarthrosis and spondyloptosis, and transcutaneous migration of the right spondylodesis pole. Three-stage surgery was indicated with explantation of the Harrington system in the first step and posterior fusion from T10 to S2 in the second step. Finally, vertebral resection, gathering of the cele, and implantation of a customized titanium cage was achieved through an anterior transabdominal approach. Postoperatively, the patient reported sufficient reduction of lower back pain. CONCLUSIONS: Lumbar anterior MC is rare in patients with NF1 and may cause spinal instability. When surgery is indicated, long-range spinal fusion and reduction of the cele should be considered. Surgery may be challenging requiring a staged operative procedure and an interdisciplinary collaboration.|Non-Cancer
ID:24829188|Title:Reducing false-positive incidental findings with ensemble genotyping and logistic regression based variant filtering methods.Abstract:As whole genome sequencing (WGS) uncovers variants associated with rare and common diseases, an immediate challenge is to minimize false-positive findings due to sequencing and variant calling errors. False positives can be reduced by combining results from orthogonal sequencing methods, but costly. Here, we present variant filtering approaches using logistic regression (LR) and ensemble genotyping to minimize false positives without sacrificing sensitivity. We evaluated the methods using paired WGS datasets of an extended family prepared using two sequencing platforms and a validated set of variants in NA12878. Using LR or ensemble genotyping based filtering, false-negative rates were significantly reduced by 1.1- to 17.8-fold at the same levels of false discovery rates (5.4% for heterozygous and 4.5% for homozygous single nucleotide variants (SNVs); 30.0% for heterozygous and 18.7% for homozygous insertions; 25.2% for heterozygous and 16.6% for homozygous deletions) compared to the filtering based on genotype quality scores. Moreover, ensemble genotyping excluded > 98% (105,080 of 107,167) of false positives while retaining > 95% (897 of 937) of true positives in de novo mutation (DNM) discovery in NA12878, and performed better than a consensus method using two sequencing platforms. Our proposed methods were effective in prioritizing phenotype-associated variants, and an ensemble genotyping would be essential to minimize false-positive DNM candidates.|Non-Cancer
ID:24835570|Title:Chromatin and transcription transitions of mammalian adult germline stem cells and spermatogenesis.Abstract:Adult germline stem cells (AGSCs) self-renew (Thy1(+) enriched) or commit to gametogenesis (Kit(+) enriched). To better understand how chromatin regulates AGSC biology and gametogenesis, we derived stage-specific high-resolution profiles of DNA methylation, 5hmC, histone modifications/variants, and RNA-seq in AGSCs and during spermatogenesis. First, we define striking signaling and transcriptional differences between AGSC types, involving key self-renewal and proliferation pathways. Second, key pluripotency factors (e.g., Nanog) are silent in AGSCs and bear particular chromatin/DNAme attributes that may "poise" them for reactivation after fertilization. Third, AGSCs display chromatin "poising/bivalency" of enhancers and promoters for embryonic transcription factors. Remarkably, gametogenesis occurs without significant changes in DNAme and instead involves transcription of DNA-methylated promoters bearing high RNAPol2, H3K9ac, H3K4me3, low CG content, and (often) 5hmC. Furthermore, key findings were confirmed in human sperm. Here, we reveal AGSC signaling asymmetries and chromatin/DNAme strategies in AGSCs to poise key transcription factors and to activate DNA-methylated promoters during gametogenesis.|Non-Cancer
ID:24850616|Title:A limited form of proteus syndrome with bilateral plantar cerebriform collagenomas and varicose veins secondary to a mosaic AKT1 mutation.Abstract:IMPORTANCE: Proteus syndrome is an extremely rare disorder of mosaic postnatal overgrowth affecting multiple tissues including bone, soft tissue, and skin. It typically manifests in early childhood with asymmetric and progressive skeletal overgrowth that leads to severe distortion of the skeleton and disability. The genetic basis has recently been identified as a somatic activating mutation in the AKT1 gene, which encodes an enzyme mediating cell proliferation and apoptosis. OBSERVATIONS: We present a 33-year-old man who developed plantar cerebriform collagenomas on the soles of both feet and varicose veins in early childhood, in the absence of any skeletal or other connective tissue abnormality. Although the patient did not meet the diagnostic criteria for Proteus syndrome, he was found to have the c.49G>A, p.Glu17Lys AKT1 mutation in lesional skin but not in his blood. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this is the mildest molecularly confirmed case of Proteus syndrome, occurring in the absence of the characteristic skeletal overgrowth. These findings extend the spectrum of Proteus syndrome pathological characteristics and suggest that somatic mutations late in development and restricted in distribution cause subtle clinical presentations that do not meet the published clinical criteria.|Non-Cancer
ID:24906339|Title:Tracking histone variant nucleosomes across the human cell cycle using biophysical, biochemical, and cytological analyses.Abstract:Histone variants such as H3.3, macroH2A, H2A.Z, and CENP-A are important epigenetic modifiers of the chromatin state in eukaryotic genomes. The centromeric histone H3 variant CENP-A/CENH3 epigenetically marks centromeres and is required for assembly of the kinetochore complex, a region of the chromosome that is responsible for proper genome segregation during mitosis. Several diverse techniques using biochemical, cell biology, and biophysical approaches have been utilized to study the nature of the CENP-A nucleosome across the cell cycle. In this chapter, we describe methods for CENP-A nucleosome purification and separation of CENP-A from other core histones using traditional SDS-PAGE and more resolving techniques such as Triton acid urea (TAU) and two-dimensional gels. We also discuss methods for observation of CENP-A on chromatin fibers using immunofluorescence. Finally, we provide a detailed description of analysis of chromatin structures using atomic force microscopy.|Non-Cancer

To our knowledge, there have been few reports of cases presenting later in life. The recognition of NF5 is important, as there have been reports of paraneoplastic manifestations and transmission to offspring. Here we present the case of a patient who presented with NF5 first appearing in her mid-50s. This case illustrates the subtle nature of NF5, which often leads to misdiagnosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:24947681|Title:Anaphylaxis as a clinical manifestation of clonal mast cell disorders.Abstract:Clonal mast cell disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the presence of gain of function KIT mutations and a constitutively altered activation-associated mast cell immunophenotype frequently associated with clinical manifestations related to the release of mast cells mediators. These disorders do not always fulfil the World Health Organization (WHO)-proposed criteria for mastocytosis, particularly when low-sensitive diagnostic approaches are performed. Anaphylaxis is a frequent presentation of clonal mast cell disorders, particularly in mastocytosis patients without typical skin lesions. The presence of cardiovascular symptoms, e.g., hypotension, occurring after a hymenoptera sting or spontaneously in the absence of cutaneous manifestations such as urticaria is characteristic and differs from the presentation of anaphylaxis in the general population without mastocytosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:24954252|Title:Accuracy of pedicle screw placement in the thoracic and lumbosacral spine using a conventional intraoperative fluoroscopy-guided technique: a national neurosurgical education and training center analysis of 1236 consecutive screws.Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Pedicle screw placement is a very common procedure used to stabilize all three columns of the thoracic and lumbar spine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of screw misplacement and related complications in patients who underwent fluoroscopy-guided transpedicular screw fixation at a neurosurgical teaching institution. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who underwent fluoroscopy-guided transpedicular screw fixation from January 2007 to May 2011 in the Department of Neurosurgery, Kantonsspital Aarau, a certified Swiss National Neurosurgical Education and Training Center. The accuracy of the pedicle screw trajectory was assessed using reconstructed postoperative axial, sagittal, and coronal computed tomography images. The displacement was classified as minor (<= 2 mm), moderate (2.1-4 mm), and severe (>4 mm). RESULTS: A total of 1236 pedicle screws were placed in 273 consecutive patients in the thoracic and lumbosacral spine. All surgeries were performed under the supervision of 7 board-certified neurosurgeons and faculty members. A total of 17 surgeons, including trainees, participated in all procedures. A total of 247 (20%) screws breaching the pedicle were identified, with 135 (10.9%) minor violations, 65 (5.3%) moderate violations, and 47 (3.8%) severe violations. Sixteen (5.9%) patients developed postoperative radiculopathy. All of these patients belonged to the subgroup of severe screw displacement. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented confirm that for a training and education center, transpedicular fluoroscopy-guided screw fixation remains a technically demanding procedure. As defined in this study, neurological symptoms are likely associated only with severe screw misplacement.|Non-Cancer
ID:24962530|Title:Evaluation and optimisation of indel detection workflows for ion torrent sequencing of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The Ion Torrent PGM is a popular benchtop sequencer that shows promise in replacing conventional Sanger sequencing as the gold standard for mutation detection. Despite the PGM's reported high accuracy in calling single nucleotide variations, it tends to generate many false positive calls in detecting insertions and deletions (indels), which may hinder its utility for clinical genetic testing. RESULTS: Recently, the proprietary analytical workflow for the Ion Torrent sequencer, Torrent Suite (TS), underwent a series of upgrades. We evaluated three major upgrades of TS by calling indels in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Our analysis revealed that false negative indels could be generated by TS under both default calling parameters and parameters adjusted for maximum sensitivity. However, indel calling with the same data using the open source variant callers, GATK and SAMtools showed that false negatives could be minimised with the use of appropriate bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, we identified two variant calling measures, Quality-by-Depth (QD) and VARiation of the Width of gaps and inserts (VARW), which substantially reduced false positive indels, including non-homopolymer associated errors without compromising sensitivity. In our best case scenario that involved the TMAP aligner and SAMtools, we achieved 100% sensitivity, 99.99% specificity and 29% False Discovery Rate (FDR) in indel calling from all 23 samples, which is a good performance for mutation screening using PGM. CONCLUSIONS: New versions of TS, BWA and GATK have shown improvements in indel calling sensitivity and specificity over their older counterpart. However, the variant caller of TS exhibits a lower sensitivity than GATK and SAMtools. Our findings demonstrate that although indel calling from PGM sequences may appear to be noisy at first glance, proper computational indel calling analysis is able to maximize both the sensitivity and specificity at the single base level, paving the way for the usage of this technology for future clinical genetic testing.|Non-Cancer
ID:24963042|Title:MPD-RC 101 prospective study of reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with myelofibrosis.Abstract:From 2007 to 2011, 66 patients with primary myelofibrosis or myelofibrosis (MF) preceded by essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera were enrolled into a prospective phase 2 clinical trial of reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT), Myeloproliferative Disorder Research Consortium 101 trial. The study included patients with sibling donors (n = 32) receiving fludarabine/melphalan (FluMel) as a preparative regimen and patients with unrelated donors (n = 34) receiving conditioning with FluMel plus anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Patient characteristics in the 2 cohorts were similar. Engraftment occurred in 97% of siblings and 76% of unrelated transplants, whereas secondary graft failure occurred in 3% and 12%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 25 months for patients alive, the overall survival (OS) was 75% in the sibling group (median not reached) and 32% in the unrelated group (median OS: 6 months, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3, 25) (hazard ratio 3.9, 95% CI: 1.8,8.9) (P < .001). Nonrelapse mortality was 22% in sibling and 59% in unrelated AHSCT. Survival correlated with type of donor, but not with the degree of histocompatibility match, age, or JAK2(V617F) status. In patients with MF with sibling donors, AHSCT is an effective therapy, whereas AHSCT from unrelated donors with FluMel/ATG conditioning led to a high rate of graft failure and limited survival. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00572897.|Non-Cancer
ID:24967879|Title:Gene expression profile in long-term non progressor HIV infected patients: in search of potential resistance factors.Abstract:Long-term non-progressors (LTNP) represent a minority (1-5%) of HIV-infected individuals characterized by documented infection for more than 7-10 years, a stable CD4+ T cell count over 500/mm(3) and low viremia in the absence of antiretroviral treatment. Protective factors described so far such as the CCR5delta32 deletion, protective HLA alleles, or defective viruses fail to fully explain the partial protection phenotype. The existence of additional host resistance mechanisms in LTNP patients was investigated here using a whole human genome microarray study comparing gene expression profiles of unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from LTNP patients, HIV-1 infected patients under antiretroviral therapy with CD4+ T cell levels above 500/mm(3) (ST), as well as healthy individuals. Genes that were up- or downregulated exclusively in LTNP, ST or in both groups in comparison to controls were identified and classified in functional categories using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. ST and LTNP patient groups revealed distinct genetic profiles, regarding gene number in each category and up- or downregulation of specific genes, which could have a bearing on the outcome of each group. We selected some relevant genes to validate the differential expression using quantitative real-time qRT-PCR. Among others, we found several genes related to the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Our results identify new possible host genes and molecules that could be involved in the mechanisms leading to the slower progression to AIDS and sustained CD4+ T cell counts that is peculiar to LTNP patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:24970375|Title:Ataxia telangiectasia derived iPS cells show preserved x-ray sensitivity and decreased chromosomal instability.Abstract:Ataxia telangiectasia is a neurodegenerative inherited disease with chromosomal instability and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. iPS cells lacking ATM (AT-iPS cells) exhibited hypersensitivity to X-ray irradiation, one of the characteristics of the disease. While parental ataxia telangiectasia cells exhibited significant chromosomal abnormalities, AT-iPS cells did not show any chromosomal instability in vitro for at least 80 passages (560 days). Whole exome analysis also showed a comparable nucleotide substitution rate in AT-iPS cells. Taken together, these data show that ATM is involved in protection from irradiation-induced cell death.|Non-Cancer
ID:25012610|Title:A novel mutation in the CSF1R gene causes a variable leukoencephalopathy with spheroids.Abstract:Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids is a neurodegenerative disease associated with mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor gene (CSF1R). A 44-year-old woman with a 7-year history of depression presented with neurological signs and a recent cognitive decline. The diagnosis of hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids was suspected based on the findings of a predominant frontal leukoencephalopathy and neuroaxonal spheroids on brain biopsy. She shares with her mother a novel CSF1R exon 18 missense mutation (c.2350G > A; p.V784M). The mother has a long-standing bipolar disorder and mild multifocal white matter abnormalities in her 70s. This is the first report of hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids due to this novel CSF1R missense mutation. Our report suggests that either marked intrafamilial variability or incomplete penetrance can be associated with CSF1R mutations. The observation of a small bone cyst in our patient supports the hypothesis that hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids and polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy may belong to a spectrum of overlapping phenotypes.|Non-Cancer
ID:25029267|Title:Dermatologic and dental aspects of the 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Statements.Abstract:IMPORTANCE: The 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Clinical Consensus Conference was convened to update the last consensus statement in 1998. Skin and dental lesions are common in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and are a frequent concern for patients. Recognition of these lesions is imperative for early diagnosis, given the treatment advances that may improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To detail recommendations for the diagnosis, surveillance, and management of skin and dental lesions in TSC. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The TSC Dermatology and Dentistry Subcommittee, 1 of 12 subcommittees, reviewed the relevant literature from 1997 to 2012. FINDINGS: A consensus on skin and dental issues was achieved within the Dermatology and Dentistry Subcommittee before recommendations were presented, discussed, and agreed on in a group meeting of all subcommittees from June 14 to 15, 2012. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Skin and dental findings comprise 4 of 11 major features and 3 of 6 minor features in the diagnostic criteria. A definite diagnosis of TSC is defined as the presence of at least 2 major features or 1 major and 2 or more minor features; in addition, a pathological mutation in TSC1 or TSC2 is diagnostic. Skin and oral examinations should be performed annually and every 3 to 6 months, respectively. Intervention may be indicated for TSC skin or oral lesions that are bleeding, symptomatic, disfiguring, or negatively affecting function. Options presented include surgical excision, laser(s), or use of a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor.|Non-Cancer
ID:25039926|Title:The presence of mast cell clonality in patients with unexplained anaphylaxis.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which mast cells in patients with unexplained anaphylaxis (UEA) are triggered remain elusive. Onset of episodes is unpredictable and often recurrent. The substantial overlap between the clinical manifestations of UEA and clonal mast cell disorders (CMD) suggests an association between these rare disorders. The two forms of CMD characterized to date are systemic mastocytosis (SM) and monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS). OBJECTIVE: To examine the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of UEA reflects the presence of aberrant subpopulations of mast cells. METHODS: Thirty (14 men, 16 women) patients (>= 18 years) suffering from UEA and with no signs of cutaneous mastocytosis were recruited. Patients underwent an initial complete allergy work-up to confirm the diagnosis of UEA. Level of baseline serum tryptase (sBT) and total IgE were determined. In addition, a bone marrow examination was performed on all 30 patients to investigate possible underlying CMD. RESULTS: Fourteen (47%) of our cases (nine men, five women) were diagnosed with CMD: 10 with SM and four with MMAS. Four of the 10 patients with SM had mast cell aggregates in their bone marrow. All patients with SM exhibited a sBT level > 11.4 ng/mL, whereas this level was elevated in only two of those with MMAS and four with UAE but not diagnosed with CMD. Total IgE levels were lower in the group of patients with CMD (P < 0.03). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The pathogenic mechanism underlying UEA could be explained by the presence of immunophenotypically aberrant mast cells with clonal markers in 47% of our subjects, indicating that clonal mast cell disorders are present in a substantial subset of these patients. Thus, the presence of CMD should be considered in patients with UEA if they have an elevated level of sBT (>= 11.4 ng/mL) and cardiovascular symptoms such as syncope.|Non-Cancer
ID:25040297|Title:The role of serum erythropoietin level and JAK2 V617F allele burden in the diagnosis of polycythaemia vera.Abstract:Low serum erythropoietin (EPO) is a minor criterion of Polycythaemia Vera (PV) but its diagnostic usefulness relies on studies performed before the discovery of JAK2 V617F mutation. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of serum EPO and JAK2 V617F allele burden as markers of PV as well as the combination of different diagnostic criteria in 287 patients (99 with PV, 137 with Essential Thrombocythaemia and 51 with non-clonal erythrocytosis). Low EPO showed good diagnostic accuracy as a marker for PV, with the area under the curve (AUC) of the chemiluminescent-enhanced enzyme immunoassay (CEIA) being better than that of radioimmunoassay (RIA) (0 87 and 0 76 for CEIA and RIA, respectively). JAK2 V617F quantification displayed an excellent diagnostic accuracy, with an AUC of 0 95. A haematocrit >52% (males) or >48% (females) plus the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation had a sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 97%, respectively. Adding low EPO or the JAK2 V617F allele burden did not improve the diagnostic accuracy for PV whereas the inclusion of both improved the sensitivity up to 83% and maintaining 96% specificity. Haematocrit and qualitative JAK2 V617F mutation allow a reliable diagnosis of PV. Incorporation of EPO and/or JAK2 V617F mutant load does not improve the diagnostic accuracy.|Non-Cancer
ID:25040471|Title:Ataxia telangiectasia: more variation at clinical and cellular levels.Abstract:Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare recessively inherited disorder resulting in a progressive neurological decline. It is caused by biallelic mutation of the ATM gene that encodes a 370 kDa serine/threonine protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating many target proteins. ATM is activated by auto(trans)phosphorylation in response to DNA double strand breaks and leads to the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and either DNA repair or apoptosis as part of the cellular response to DNA damage. The allelic heterogeneity in A-T is striking. While the majority of mutations are truncating, leading to instability and loss of the ATM protein from the allele, a significant proportion of patients carry one of a small number of mutations that are either missense or leaky splice site mutations resulting in retention of some ATM with activity. The allelic heterogeneity in ATM, therefore, results in an equally striking clinical heterogeneity. There is also locus heterogeneity because mutation of the MRE11 gene can cause an obvious A-T like disorder both clinically and also at the cellular level and mutation of the RNF168 gene results in a much milder clinical phenotype, neurologically, with the major clinical feature being an immunological defect.|Non-Cancer
ID:25044986|Title:Prenatal diagnosis of CLOVES syndrome confirmed by detection of a mosaic PIK3CA mutation in cultured amniocytes.Abstract:Congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies (CLOVES) syndrome, a segmental overgrowth syndrome, is caused by post zygotic somatic mutations in PIK3CA, a gene involved in the receptor tyrosine kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3)-AKT growth-signaling pathway. Prenatal ultrasound findings of lymphovascular malformations, segmental overgrowth and skeletal defects can raise suspicion for CLOVES syndrome, but molecular confirmation of PIK3CA mutations on prenatally obtained samples is challenging because of somatic mosaicism. We detected a mosaic disease-causing mutation in PIK3CA by sequencing of DNA extracted from cultured amniotic cells, but not from DNA directly prepared from an amniotic fluid sample in a fetus with prenatally suspected CLOVES syndrome. The infant was born prematurely and displayed severe lymphovascular malformations and segmental overgrowth consistent with a clinical diagnosis of CLOVES syndrome; he passed away at 29 days of life. We discuss the complexities and limitations of genetic testing for somatic mosaic mutations in the prenatal period and highlight the potential need for multiple approaches to arrive at a molecular diagnosis.   2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.|Non-Cancer
ID:25081057|Title:Selective suppression of excessive GluN2C expression rescues early epilepsy in a tuberous sclerosis murine model.Abstract:Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), caused by dominant mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 tumour suppressor genes is characterized by the presence of brain malformations, the cortical tubers that are thought to contribute to the generation of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Here we report that tuberless heterozygote Tsc1(+/-) mice show functional upregulation of cortical GluN2C-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in an mTOR-dependent manner and exhibit recurrent, unprovoked seizures during early postnatal life (<P19). Seizures are generated intracortically in the granular layer of the neocortex. Slow kinetics of aberrant GluN2C-mediated currents in spiny stellate cells promotes excessive temporal integration of persistent NMDAR-mediated recurrent excitation and seizure generation. Accordingly, specific GluN2C/D antagonists block seizures in Tsc1(+/-) mice in vivo and in vitro. Likewise, GluN2C expression is upregulated in TSC human surgical resections, and a GluN2C/D antagonist reduces paroxysmal hyperexcitability. Thus, GluN2C receptor constitutes a promising molecular target to treat epilepsy in TSC patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:25088585|Title:Participation of the E3-ligase TRIM13 in NF-kappaB p65 activation and NFAT-dependent activation of c-Rel upon T-cell receptor engagement.Abstract:The nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) family members p65 and c-Rel chiefly orchestrate lymphocytes activation following T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement. In contrast to p65, which is rapidly mobilized, c-Rel activation occurs subsequently as it involves a nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)-dependent upregulation step. However, how TCR ligation drives p65 and c-Rel activation is not fully understood. Because several ubiquitylated components of NF-kappaB signaling cascade accumulate in close proximity to membranes, we screened a siRNA library against E3-ligases that contain transmembrane domains on TCR-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Here, we report the identification of the endoplasmic reticulum resident TRIM13 protein as an enhancer of NF-kappaB promoter activity. We found that knocking down TRIM13 by RNA interference reduced the activation of p65, while the translocation of c-Rel into the nucleus was blunted. We further observed that c-Rel induction was diminished without TRIM13, as NFAT activation was compromised. These results unveil that TRIM13 is a selective regulator of p65 and of c-Rel activation.|Non-Cancer
ID:25116393|Title:Overexpression of Gremlin-1 in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome: implications on pathophysiology and early disease detection.Abstract:BACKGROUNDS: The Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an inherited connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptors TGFBR1 or TGFBR2. Most patients with LDS develop severe aortic aneurysms resulting in early need of surgical intervention. In order to gain further insight into the pathophysiology of the disorder, we investigated circulating outgrowth endothelial cells (OEC) from the peripheral blood of LDS patients from a cohort of 23 patients including 6 patients with novel TGF-beta receptor mutations. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed gene expression profiling of OECs using microarray analysis followed by quantitative PCR for verification of gene expression. Compared to OECs of age- and sex-matched healthy controls, OECs isolated from three LDS patients displayed altered expression of several genes belonging to the TGF-beta pathway, especially those affecting bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling including BMP2, BMP4 and BMPR1A. Gene expression of BMP antagonist Gremlin-1 (GREM1) showed the most prominent up-regulation. This increase was confirmed at the protein level by immunoblotting of LDS-OECs. In immunohistochemistry, abundant Gremlin-1 protein expression could be verified in endothelial cells as well as smooth muscle cells within the arterial media. Furthermore, Gremlin-1 plasma levels of LDS patients were significantly elevated compared to healthy control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These findings open new avenues in the understanding of the pathogenesis of Loeys-Dietz syndrome and the development of new diagnostic serological methods for early disease detection.|Non-Cancer
ID:25122853|Title:Poor performance of the determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab combo fourth-generation rapid test for detection of acute infections in a National Household Survey in Swaziland.Abstract:Fourth-generation HIV rapid tests (RTs) claim to detect both p24 antigen (Ag) and HIV antibodies (Ab) for early identification of acute infections, important for targeting prevention and reducing HIV transmission. In a nationally representative household survey in Swaziland, 18,172 adults, age 18 to 49 years, received home-based HIV rapid testing in 2010 and 2011. Of the 18,172 individuals, 5,822 (32.0%) were Ab positive (Ab(+)) by the Determine HIV-1/2 Ab/Ab combo test, and 5,789 (99.4%) of those were confirmed to be reactive in the Uni-Gold test. Determine combo identified 12 individuals as having acute infections (Ag(+)/Ab negative [Ab(-)]); however, none had detectable HIV-1 RNA and 8 of 12 remained HIV negative at their 6-week follow-up visit (4 were lost to follow-up). All RT-nonreactive samples were pooled and tested by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) to identify acute infections. NAAT identified 13 (0.1%) of the 12,338 HIV antibody-negative specimens as HIV RNA positive, with RNA levels ranging from 300 to >10,000,000 copies/ml. However, none of them were Ag(+) by Determine combo. Follow-up testing of 12 of the 13 NAAT-positive individuals at 6 months demonstrated 12 seroconversions (1 individual was lost to follow-up). Therefore, the Determine combo test had a sensitivity of 0% (95% confidence interval, 0 to 28) and positive predictive value of 0% for the detection of acute infections. The ability of the 4th-generation Determine combo to detect antigen was very poor in Swaziland. Thus, the Determine combo test does not add any value to the current testing algorithm; rather, it adds additional costs and complexity to HIV diagnosis. The detection of acute HIV infections may need to rely on other testing strategies.|Non-Cancer
ID:25123125|Title:Metabolism and insulin signaling in common metabolic disorders and inherited insulin resistance.Abstract:Type 2 diabetes, obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are common metabolic disorders which are observed with increasing prevalences, and which are caused by a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, including increased calorie intake and physical inactivity. These metabolic disorders are all characterized by reduced plasma adiponectin and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Quantitatively skeletal muscle is the major site of insulin resistance. Both low plasma adiponectin and insulin resistance contribute to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In several studies, we have investigated insulin action on glucose and lipid metabolism, and at the molecular level, insulin signaling to glucose transport and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle from healthy individuals and in obesity, PCOS and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, we have described a novel syndrome characterized by postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and insulin resistance. This syndrome is caused by a mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor gene (INSR). We have studied individuals with this mutation as a model of inherited insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes, obesity and PCOS are characterized by pronounced defects in the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, in particular glycogen synthesis and to a lesser extent glucose oxidation, and the ability of insulin to suppress lipid oxidation. In inherited insulin resistance, however, only insulin action on glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis is impaired. This suggests that the defects in glucose and lipid oxidation in the common metabolic disorders are secondary to other factors. In young women with PCOS, the degree of insulin resistance was similar to that seen in middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes. This supports the hypothesis of an unique pathogenesis of insulin resistance in PCOS. Insulin in physiological concentrations stimulates glucose uptake in human skeletal muscle in vivo by activation of the insulin signaling cascade to glucose transport through the enzymes IRS1, PI3K, Akt2, AS160/TBC1D4 and RAC1, and to glycogen synthesis through Akt2, inhibition of GSK3 and activation of glycogen synthase (GS) via dephosphorylation of serine residues in both the NH2-terminal (site 2+2a) and the COOH-terminal end (site 3a+3b). In type 2 diabetes, obesity and PCOS, there is, although with some variation from study to study, defects in insulin signaling through IRS1, PI3K, Akt2 and AS160/TBC1D4, which can explain reduced insulin action on glucose transport. In type 2 diabetes an altered intracellular distribution of SNAP23 and impaired activation of RAC1 also seem to play a role for reduced insulin action on glucose transport. In all common metabolic disorders, we observed an impaired insulin activation of GS, which seems to be caused by attenuated dephosphorylation of GS at site 2+2a, whereas as the inhibition of GSK3 and the dephosphorylation of GS at its target sites, site 3a+3a, appeared to be completely normal. In individuals with inherited insulin resistance, we observed largely the same defects in insulin action on IRS1, PI3K, Akt2 and GS, as well as a normal inhibition of GSK3 and dephosphorylation of GS at site 3a+3b. In these individuals, however, a markedly reduced insulin clearance seems to partially rescue insulin signaling to glucose transport and GS. Adiponectin is thought to improve insulin sensitivity primarily by increasing lipid oxidation through activation of the enzyme AMPK, and possibly via cross-talking of adiponectin with insulin signaling, and hence glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. We demonstrated a strong correlation between plasma adiponectin and insulin action on glucose disposal and glycogen synthesis in obesity, type 2 diabetes and PCOS. In individuals with inherited insulin resistance, plasma adiponectin was normal, but the correlation of adiponectin with insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis was at least equally strong. Moreover, we found a correlation between plasma adiponectin and insulin activation of GS. This result is supported by a number of recent studies of animal models and muscle cell lines, which have shown that adiponectin augments insulin action on enzymes in the insulin signaling cascade. In contrast, we observed no differences in the abundance or activity of AMPK in obesity, type 2 diabetes, PCOS or inherited insulin resistance. This indicates that reduced insulin sensitivity in these conditions is not mediated via abnormal AMPK activity. The results from these studies demonstrate that the well-established abnormalities in insulin action on glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis are reflected by defects in insulin signaling to these cellular processes in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and PCOS, and as expected also in inherited insulin resistance caused by a mutation in INSR. In common metabolic disorders, low plasma adiponectin may contribute to insulin resistance and defects in insulin signaling, whereas in inherited insulin resistance a normal plasma adiponectin and reduced insulin clearance could contribute to maintain a sufficient activation of the insulin signaling cascade. The insight gained from these studies have improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of humans, and can form the basis for further studies, which can lead to the development of treatment that more directly targets insulin resistance, and hence reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.|Non-Cancer
ID:25160545|Title:Early neurodevelopmental screening in tuberous sclerosis complex: a potential window of opportunity.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Infants born with tuberous sclerosis complex, a genetic condition resulting from a mutation in TSC1 or TSC2, are at increased risk for intellectual disability and/or autism. Features of epilepsy, neuropathology, genetics, as well as timing and type of mechanism-based medications have been proposed as risk factors. Neurodevelopmental outcomes have been reported among these studies; however, few include data about the individuals' early neurodevelopmental profile, a factor that may contribute significantly to these outcomes. Further, there is no clinical standard for the neurodevelopmental assessment of these infants. The paucity of data regarding the natural history of neurodevelopment in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex and the lack of a gold standard for neurodevelopmental evaluation present a significant challenge for clinicians and researchers. METHOD: During the first year of life, we tracked the onset of infantile spasms, the type and timing of antiepileptic treatments, and the associated response of two age-matched infants with tuberous sclerosis complex. We also employed Capute Scales as a part of a structured neurodevelopmental evaluation to characterize and compare their neurodevelopmental profiles. RESULTS: Infant 1 developed infantile spasms with confirmed hypsarrhythmia at 4 months of age. Treatment with vigabatrin was initiated within 24 hours with near immediate cessation of seizures and no further seizures to date. Expressive language delay was detected at 12 months and treated with speech and/or language therapy. Infant 2 developed complex partial seizures at 1 month. Treatment included levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and the ketogenic diet. Vigabatrin was initiated on detection of hypsarrhythmia after 4 months. Intractable epilepsy persists to date. Global developmental delay was evident by 8 months and treated with physical, occupational, and speech and/or language therapy. CONCLUSION: Many risk factors have been associated with intellectual disability and/or autism in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex; however, few data are available regarding practical clinical tools for early identification. In our case series, inclusion of the Capute Scales as a part of routine medical care led to the identification of developmental delays in the first 12 months of life and selection of targeted neurodevelopmental interventions. Development of a risk-based assessment using this approach will be the focus of future studies as it may provide a potential window of opportunity for both research and clinical purposes. In research, it may serve as an objective outcome measure. Clinically, this type of assessment has potential for informing clinical treatment decisions and serving as a prognostic indicator of long-term cognitive and psychiatric outcomes.|Non-Cancer
ID:25171276|Title:Prognostic value of postoperative urinary retention after male sling insertion.Abstract:INTRODUCTION: While urinary retention is a known complication of AdVance male sling (AMS) placement for post-prostatectomy incontinence (PPI), there is minimal data regarding ultimate continence outcomes for patients who experience this complication. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of continence after AMS placement in patients who had postoperative urinary retention as compared with those patients who did not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent AMS placement for PPI between 2008 and 2011 with postoperative void trial (TOV). Preoperative factors such as urodynamic findings, daily pad number (PPD) and weight were recorded. Follow up data included pad use, need for catheterization and complications. Statistical analysis compared patients with and without postoperative urinary retention. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included with a mean follow up of 11.8 months. Complete continence was 60%, while 83% of patients were improved. PPD improved from 2.9 pads to 0.8 pads after AMS placement. Sixteen patients (46%) had postoperative urinary retention requiring clean intermittent catheterization (CIC). Of the 16 patients in postoperative retention, 100% were completely continent (PPD = 0), compared to 5 of 19 patients (26%) who passed first TOV (p < 0.00001). All patients who required CIC were able to void within 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative urinary retention after AMS placement for PPI occurs in about 50% of patients and is short-lived. Patients who experienced postoperative urinary retention had good continence outcomes.|Non-Cancer
ID:25174872|Title:IL-10/Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling dysregulates Bim expression in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a human disorder of T cell homeostasis caused by mutations that impair FAS-mediated apoptosis. A defining characteristic of ALPS is the expansion of double negative T cells (DNTC). Relatively little is known about how defective FAS-driven cell death and the Bcl-2 apoptotic pathway intersect in ALPS patients. OBJECTIVE: We studied changes in Bcl-2 family member expression in ALPS to determine whether the Bcl-2 pathway might provide a therapeutic target. METHODS: We used flow cytometry to analyze the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in T cells from 12 ALPS patients and determined the in vitro sensitivity of ALPS DNTC to the pro-apoptotic BH3 mimetic, ABT-737. RESULTS: The pro-apoptotic molecule, Bim, was significantly elevated in DNTC. Although no general pattern of individual anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members emerged, increased expression of Bim was always accompanied by increased expression of at least 1 anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member. Strikingly, Bim levels in DNTC correlated significantly with serum IL-10 in ALPS patients, and IL-10 was sufficient to mildly induce Bim in normal and ALPS T cells via a Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-dependent mechanism. Finally, ABT-737 preferentially killed ALPS DNTC in vitro. CONCLUSION: Combined, these data show that an IL-10/Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway drives Bim expression in ALPS DNTC, which renders them sensitive to BH3 mimetics, uncovering a potentially novel therapeutic approach to ALPS.|Non-Cancer
ID:25246557|Title:Bimodal activation of BubR1 by Bub3 sustains mitotic checkpoint signaling.Abstract:The mitotic checkpoint (also known as the spindle assembly checkpoint) prevents premature anaphase onset through generation of an inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C, whose ubiquitination of cyclin B and securin targets them for degradation. Combining in vitro reconstitution and cell-based assays, we now identify dual mechanisms through which Bub3 promotes mitotic checkpoint signaling. Bub3 enhances signaling at unattached kinetochores not only by facilitating binding of BubR1 but also by enhancing Cdc20 recruitment to kinetochores mediated by BubR1's internal Cdc20 binding site. Downstream of kinetochore-produced complexes, Bub3 promotes binding of BubR1's conserved, amino terminal Cdc20 binding domain to a site in Cdc20 that becomes exposed by initial Mad2 binding. This latter Bub3-stimulated event generates the final mitotic checkpoint complex of Bub3-BubR1-Cdc20 that selectively inhibits ubiquitination of securin and cyclin B by APC/C(Cdc20). Thus, Bub3 promotes two distinct BubR1-Cdc20 interactions, involving each of the two Cdc20 binding sites of BubR1 and acting at unattached kinetochores or cytoplasmically, respectively, to facilitate production of the mitotic checkpoint inhibitor.|Non-Cancer
ID:25246615|Title:Mastl is required for timely activation of APC/C in meiosis I and Cdk1 reactivation in meiosis II.Abstract:In mitosis, the Greatwall kinase (called microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase like [Mastl] in mammals) is essential for prometaphase entry or progression by suppressing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity. PP2A suppression in turn leads to high levels of Cdk1 substrate phosphorylation. We have used a mouse model with an oocyte-specific deletion of Mastl to show that Mastl-null oocytes resume meiosis I and reach metaphase I normally but that the onset and completion of anaphase I are delayed. Moreover, after the completion of meiosis I, Mastl-null oocytes failed to enter meiosis II (MII) because they reassembled a nuclear structure containing decondensed chromatin. Our results show that Mastl is required for the timely activation of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome to allow meiosis I exit and for the rapid rise of Cdk1 activity that is needed for the entry into MII in mouse oocytes.|Non-Cancer
ID:25282103|Title:Defining the role of common variation in the genomic and biological architecture of adult human height.Abstract:Using genome-wide data from 253,288 individuals, we identified 697 variants at genome-wide significance that together explained one-fifth of the heritability for adult height. By testing different numbers of variants in independent studies, we show that the most strongly associated ~2,000, ~3,700 and ~9,500 SNPs explained ~21%, ~24% and ~29% of phenotypic variance. Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60% of heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not highlighted in earlier efforts, such as signaling by fibroblast growth factors, WNT/beta-catenin and chondroitin sulfate-related genes. We identified several genes and pathways not previously connected with human skeletal growth, including mTOR, osteoglycin and binding of hyaluronic acid. Our results indicate a genetic architecture for human height that is characterized by a very large but finite number (thousands) of causal variants.|Non-Cancer
ID:25310214|Title:Langerhans cell histiocytosis.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare histiocytic disorder of unknown etiopathogenesis. Its clinical presentation is variable and ranges from isolated skin or bone disease to a life-threatening multisystem condition. LCH can occur at any age but is more frequent in the pediatric population. A neoplastic origin of this disease has been suggested due to the discovery of the mutually exclusive activating somatic BRAF V600E and MAP2K1 gene mutations that occur in about 75% of patients. METHODS: A survey of recent literature focused on the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Data were collected, analyzed, and discussed with an emphasis on contemporary clinical practice. RESULTS: LCH is common in the pediatric population; compared with adults, children usually have a more aggressive clinical course that requires systemic chemotherapy. Patients with low-risk LCH have an excellent prognosis and a long-term survival rate that may be as high as 99%; by contrast, patients with high-risk LCH have a survival rate close to 80%. Typically, adult patients present with limited skin or bone involvement that can be treated with surgical resection or focal radiation therapy, resulting in an overall survival rate of 100%. Smoking cessation can result in the improvement of respiratory symptoms and the spontaneous resolution of pulmonary LCH. Targeted therapy with BRAF inhibitors has been used in select patients with LCH, and the results have been encouraging. CONCLUSIONS: Our understanding of LCH has improved in the last 20 years. Available treatment regimens can control the disease in the majority of patients. The discovery of novel driver mutations and the development of targeted therapy promise better outcomes with fewer long-term therapy-related adverse events, particularly for pediatric and adolescent patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:25313664|Title:Gene therapy for inherited muscle diseases: where genetics meets rehabilitation medicine.Abstract:The development of clinical vectors to correct genetic mutations that cause inherited myopathies and related disorders of skeletal muscle is advancing at an impressive rate. Adeno-associated virus vectors are attractive for clinical use because (1) adeno-associated viruses do not cause human disease and (2) these vectors are able to persist for years. New vectors are now becoming available as gene therapy delivery tools, and recent preclinical experiments have demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of gene therapy with adeno-associated virus for long-term correction of muscle pathology and weakness in myotubularin-deficient canine and murine disease models. In this review, recent advances in the application of gene therapies to treat inherited muscle disorders are presented, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy and x-linked myotubular myopathy. Potential areas for therapeutic synergies between rehabilitation medicine and genetics are also discussed.|Non-Cancer
ID:25324352|Title:Prospective blinded study of BRAFV600E mutation detection in cell-free DNA of patients with systemic histiocytic disorders.Abstract:UNLABELLED: Patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) have a high frequency of BRAF(V600E) mutations and respond to RAF inhibitors. However, detection of mutations in tissue biopsies is particularly challenging in histiocytoses due to low tumor content and stromal contamination. We applied a droplet-digital PCR assay for quantitative detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in plasma and urine cell-free (cf) DNA and performed a prospective, blinded study in 30 patients with ECD/LCH. There was 100% concordance between tissue and urinary cfDNA genotype in treatment-naive samples. cfDNA analysis facilitated identification of previously undescribed KRAS(G12S)-mutant ECD and dynamically tracked disease burden in patients treated with a variety of therapies. These results indicate that cfDNA BRAF(V600E) mutational analysis in plasma and urine provides a convenient and reliable method of detecting mutational status and can serve as a noninvasive biomarker to monitor response to therapy in LCH and ECD. SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant histiocytic disorders have remarkable responses to RAF inhibition, but mutation detection in tissue in these disorders is challenging. Here, we identify that analysis of plasma and urinary cfDNA provides a reliable method to detect the BRAF(V600E) mutation and monitor response to therapy in these disorders.|Non-Cancer
ID:25324521|Title:Microscopic validation of macroscopic in vivo images enabled by same-slide optical and nuclear fusion.Abstract:UNLABELLED: It is currently difficult to determine the molecular and cellular basis for radioscintigraphic signals obtained during macroscopic in vivo imaging. The field is in need of technology that helps bridge the macroscopic and microscopic regimes. To solve this problem, we developed a fiducial marker (FM) simultaneously compatible with 2-color near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700 and 800 nm), autoradiography, and conventional hematoxylin-eosin (HE) histology. METHODS: The FM was constructed from an optimized concentration of commercially available human serum albumin, 700- and 800-nm NIR fluorophores, (99m)Tc-pertechnetate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and glutaraldehyde. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis cells coexpressing the sodium iodide symporter and green fluorescent protein were labeled with 700-nm fluorophore and (99m)Tc-pertechnatate and then administered intratracheally into CD-1 mice. After in vivo SPECT imaging and ex vivo SPECT and NIR fluorescence imaging of the lungs, 30-mum frozen sections were prepared and processed for 800-nm NIR fluorophore costaining, autoradiography, and HE staining on the same slide using the FMs to coregister all datasets. RESULTS: Optimized FMs, composed of 100 muM unlabeled human serum albumin, 1 muM NIR fluorescent human serum albumin, 15% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 3% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), were prepared within 15 min, displayed homogeneity and stability, and were visible by all imaging modalities, including HE staining. Using these FMs, tissue displaying high signal by SPECT could be dissected and analyzed on the same slide and at the microscopic level for 700-nm NIR fluorescence, 800-nm NIR fluorescence, autoradiography, and HE histopathologic staining. CONCLUSION: When multimodal FMs are combined with a new technique for simultaneous same-slide NIR fluorescence imaging, autoradiography, and HE staining, macroscopic in vivo images can now be studied unambiguously at the microscopic level.|Non-Cancer
ID:25347658|Title:Minimally invasive options in Dupuytren's contracture: aponeurotomy, enzymes, stretching, and fat grafting.Abstract:LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After studying this article, the participant should be able to: (1) Perform needle aponeurotomy, fat grafting, Digit Widget insertion, and collagenase injection for Dupuytren's cords. (2) Describe how cords can be stretched without surgery. (3) Explain to patients the risks and benefits of these new alternatives of treatments. SUMMARY: Surgery for Dupuytren's contracture used to be the only alternative of treatment. The past 5 years have seen the widespread adoption of minimally invasive treatments in the form of needle aponeurotomy and collagenase injection to disrupt the cords and restore range of motion. Even newer and perhaps as effective treatments such as fat grafting and mechanical stretching with the Digit Widget may also end up being important tools of treatment. The reader will be introduced to all of these modalities with text, illustration, and videos.|Non-Cancer
ID:25367873|Title:Early-onset Crohn's disease and autoimmunity associated with a variant in CTLA-4.Abstract:OBJECTIVE: IBD is a group of complex, systemic disorders associated with intestinal inflammation and extraintestinal manifestations. Recent studies revealed Mendelian forms of IBD, which contributed significantly to our understanding of disease pathogenesis and the heritability of IBD. DESIGN: We performed exome sequencing in a family with Crohn's disease (CD) and severe autoimmunity, analysed immune cell phenotype and function in affected and non-affected individuals, and performed in silico and in vitro analyses of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) structure and function. RESULTS: A novel missense variant was identified in CTLA4 encoding CTLA-4, a coinhibitory protein expressed by T cells and required for regulation of T cell activation. The residue affected by the mutation, CTLA-4 Tyr60, is evolutionarily highly conserved, and the identified Y60C variant is predicted to affect protein folding and structural stability and demonstrated to cause impaired CTLA-4 dimerisation and CD80 binding. Intestinal inflammation and autoimmunity in carriers of CTLA-4 Y60C exhibit incomplete penetrance with a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic carrier status to fatal autoimmunity and intestinal inflammation. In a clinically affected CTLA-4 Y60C carrier, T cell proliferation was increased in vitro and associated with an increased ratio of memory to naive T cells in vivo, consistent with impaired regulation of T cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the concept that variants in CTLA4 provide the basis for a novel Mendelian form of early-onset CD associated with systemic autoimmunity. Incomplete penetrance of autoimmunity further indicates the presence of other genetic and/or environmental modifiers.|Non-Cancer
ID:25381388|Title:The immunophenotype of mast cells and its utility in the diagnostic work-up of systemic mastocytosis.Abstract:SM comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders, characterized by an abnormal accumulation of clonal MCs in 1 or more tissues, frequently involving the skin and BM. Despite the fact that most adult patients (>90%) carry the same genetic lesion (D816V KIT mutation), the disease presents with multiple variants with very distinct clinical and biologic features, a diverse prognosis, and different therapeutic requirements. Recent advances in the standardization of the study of BM MC by MFC allowed reproducible identification and characterization of normal/reactive MCs and their precursors, as well as the establishment of the normal MC maturational profiles. Analysis of large groups of patients versus normal/reactive samples has highlighted the existence of aberrant MC phenotypes in SM, which are essential for the diagnosis of the disease. In turn, 3 clearly distinct and altered maturation-associated immunophenotypic profiles have been reported recently in SM, which provide criteria for the distinction between ISM patients with MC-restricted and multilineage KIT mutation; thus, immunphenotyping also contributes to prognostic stratification of ISM, particularly when analysis of the KIT mutation on highly purified BM cells is not routinely available in the diagnostic work-up of the disease.|Non-Cancer
ID:25399868|Title:TRF2 and lamin A/C interact to facilitate the functional organization of chromosome ends.Abstract:Telomeres protect the ends of linear genomes, and the gradual loss of telomeres is associated with cellular ageing. Telomere protection involves the insertion of the 3' overhang facilitated by telomere repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) into telomeric DNA, forming t-loops. We present evidence suggesting that t-loops can also form at interstitial telomeric sequences in a TRF2-dependent manner, forming an interstitial t-loop (ITL). We demonstrate that TRF2 association with interstitial telomeric sequences is stabilized by co-localization with A-type lamins (lamin A/C). We also find that lamin A/C interacts with TRF2 and that reduction in levels of lamin A/C or mutations in LMNA that cause an autosomal dominant premature ageing disorder--Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS)-lead to reduced ITL formation and telomere loss. We propose that cellular and organismal ageing are intertwined through the effects of the interaction between TRF2 and lamin A/C on chromosome structure.|Non-Cancer
ID:25401994|Title:Jak2 mutation-positive polycythemia vera presenting as central retinal artery occlusion.Abstract:PURPOSE: To report the case of a 49-year-old man who presented with profound visual loss in his right eye because of a central retinal artery occlusion, accompanied by a stroke in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery with left upper extremity sequelae. METHODS: The patient underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination, fluorescein angiography, thorough neuroophthalmology evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography, 12-lead electrocardiogram, transesophageal echocardiogram, bilateral carotid artery Doppler, Holter monitoring, comprehensive laboratory testing, bone marrow biopsy, and genetic testing. RESULTS: Despite an initially normal hematocrit, the etiology of the central retinal artery occlusion and that of the nearly concomitant stroke in the right medial cerebral artery territory was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy to be polycythemia vera (positive JAK2 mutation). Patient received treatment with aspirin, serial phlebotomies, and hydroxyurea, demonstrating a slight improvement in vision and substantial normalization of neurologic and hematological status. At the time of this report, 2 years later, patient remains stable. CONCLUSION: Central retinal artery occlusion, a disease with a frequently devastating visual outcome, is often not an "isolated" ocular occurrence. In the absence of an obvious local trigger, a thorough work-up is always warranted, especially in younger patients, as the ocular pathology oftentimes may herald severe cerebro-cardiovascular events.|Non-Cancer
ID:25441388|Title:Differentiating skin-limited and multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis.Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To identify features associated with multisystem involvement and therapeutic failure in patients with skin Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed medical records of 71 consecutive patients with LCH with skin involvement evaluated at Texas Children's Hospital and analyzed clinical features, laboratory results, and the presence of circulating cells with the BRAF-V600E mutation with respect to initial staging and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Skin disease in patients older than 18 months of age at diagnosis was associated with the presence of multisystem disease (OR, 9.65; 95% CI, 1.17-79.4). Forty percent of patients referred for presumed skin-limited LCH had underlying multisystem involvement, one-half of these with risk-organ involvement. Patients with skin-limited LCH had a 3-year progression-free survival of 89% after initial therapy, and none developed multisystem disease. Patients with skin/multisystem involvement had a 3-year progression-free survival of 44% with vinblastine/prednisone therapy, and risk-organ involvement did not correlate with failure to achieve nonactive disease. Circulating cells with BRAF-V600E were detected at higher frequency in patients with multisystem involvement (8 of 11 skin/multisystem vs 1 of 13 skin-limited; P = .002). CONCLUSION: Skin-limited LCH necessitates infrequent therapeutic intervention and has a lower risk of progression relative to skin plus multisystem LCH. The less-aggressive clinical course and lack of circulating cells with the BRAF-V600E mutation in skin-limited LCH suggest a different mechanism of disease origin compared with multisystem or risk-organ disease.|Non-Cancer
ID:25468659|Title:Loss of function in heparan sulfate elongation genes EXT1 and EXT 2 results in improved nitric oxide bioavailability and endothelial function.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Heparanase is the major enzyme involved in degradation of endothelial heparan sulfates, which is associated with impaired endothelial nitric oxide synthesis. However, the effect of heparan sulfate chain length in relation to endothelial function and nitric oxide availability has never been investigated. We studied the effect of heterozygous mutations in heparan sulfate elongation genes EXT1 and EXT2 on endothelial function in vitro as well as in vivo. METHODS AND RESULT: Flow-mediated dilation, a marker of nitric oxide bioavailability, was studied in Ext1(+/-) and Ext2(+/-) mice versus controls (n=7 per group), as well as in human subjects with heterozygous loss of function mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 (n=13 hereditary multiple exostoses and n=13 controls). Endothelial function was measured in microvascular endothelial cells under laminar flow with or without siRNA targeting EXT1 or EXT2. Endothelial glycocalyx and maximal arteriolar dilatation were significantly altered in Ext1(+/-) and Ext2(+/-) mice compared to wild-type littermates (glycocalyx: wild-type 0.67+-0.1 mum, Ext1(+/-) 0.28+-0.1 mum and Ext2(+/-) 0.25+-0.1 mum, P<0.01, maximal arteriolar dilation during reperfusion: wild-type 11.3+-1.0%), Ext1(+/-) 15.2+-1.4% and Ext2(+/-) 13.8+-1.6% P<0.05). In humans, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation was significantly increased in hereditary multiple exostoses patients (hereditary multiple exostoses 8.1+-0.8% versus control 5.6+-0.7%, P<0.05). In line, silencing of microvascular endothelial cell EXT1 and EXT2 under flow led to significant upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthesis and phospho-endothelial nitric oxide synthesis protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our data implicate that heparan sulfate elongation genes EXT1 and EXT2 are involved in maintaining endothelial homeostasis, presumably via increased nitric oxide bioavailability.|Non-Cancer
ID:25476696|Title:Intestinal epithelial MyD88 is a sensor switching host metabolism towards obesity according to nutritional status.Abstract:Obesity is associated with a cluster of metabolic disorders, low-grade inflammation and altered gut microbiota. Whether host metabolism is controlled by intestinal innate immune system and the gut microbiota is unknown. Here we report that inducible intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of MyD88 partially protects against diet-induced obesity, diabetes and inflammation. This is associated with increased energy expenditure, an improved glucose homeostasis, reduced hepatic steatosis, fat mass and inflammation. Protection is transferred following gut microbiota transplantation to germ-free recipients. We also demonstrate that intestinal epithelial MyD88 deletion increases anti-inflammatory endocannabinoids, restores antimicrobial peptides production and increases intestinal regulatory T cells during diet-induced obesity. Targeting MyD88 after the onset of obesity reduces fat mass and inflammation. Our work thus identifies intestinal epithelial MyD88 as a sensor changing host metabolism according to the nutritional status and we show that targeting intestinal epithelial MyD88 constitutes a putative therapeutic target for obesity and related disorders.|Non-Cancer
ID:25486933|Title:Strategy for identifying repurposed drugs for the treatment of cerebral cavernous malformation.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a hemorrhagic stroke disease affecting up to 0.5% of North Americans that has no approved nonsurgical treatment. A subset of patients have a hereditary form of the disease due primarily to loss-of-function mutations in KRIT1, CCM2, or PDCD10. We sought to identify known drugs that could be repurposed to treat CCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed an unbiased screening platform based on both cellular and animal models of loss of function of CCM2. Our discovery strategy consisted of 4 steps: an automated immunofluorescence and machine-learning-based primary screen of structural phenotypes in human endothelial cells deficient in CCM2, a secondary screen of functional changes in endothelial stability in these same cells, a rapid in vivo tertiary screen of dermal microvascular leak in mice lacking endothelial Ccm2, and finally a quaternary screen of CCM lesion burden in these same mice. We screened 2100 known drugs and bioactive compounds and identified 2 candidates, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and tempol (a scavenger of superoxide), for further study. Each drug decreased lesion burden in a mouse model of CCM vascular disease by  50%. CONCLUSIONS: By identifying known drugs as potential therapeutics for CCM, we have decreased the time, cost, and risk of bringing treatments to patients. Each drug also prompts additional exploration of biomarkers of CCM disease. We further suggest that the structure-function screening platform presented here may be adapted and scaled to facilitate drug discovery for diverse loss-of-function genetic vascular disease.|Non-Cancer
ID:25488918|Title:BRCA2 diffuses as oligomeric clusters with RAD51 and changes mobility after DNA damage in live cells.Abstract:Genome maintenance by homologous recombination depends on coordinating many proteins in time and space to assemble at DNA break sites. To understand this process, we followed the mobility of BRCA2, a critical recombination mediator, in live cells at the single-molecule level using both single-particle tracking and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. BRCA2-GFP and -YFP were compared to distinguish diffusion from fluorophore behavior. Diffusive behavior of fluorescent RAD51 and RAD54 was determined for comparison. All fluorescent proteins were expressed from endogenous loci. We found that nuclear BRCA2 existed in oligomeric clusters, and exhibited heterogeneous mobility. DNA damage increased BRCA2 transient binding, presumably including binding to damaged sites. Despite its very different size, RAD51 displayed mobility similar to BRCA2, which indicates physical interaction between these proteins both before and after induction of DNA damage. We propose that BRCA2-mediated sequestration of nuclear RAD51 serves to prevent inappropriate DNA interactions and that all RAD51 is delivered to DNA damage sites in association with BRCA2.|Non-Cancer
ID:25522665|Title:Regulation of T cells by mTOR: the known knowns and the known unknowns.Abstract:Mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is emerging as an important integrator of environmental cues critical for the regulation of T cell activation, differentiation, and function. Recent studies leveraging pharmacologic inhibition or T cell specific genetic deletion of signaling components in the mTOR pathway have provided important insights into the mechanisms involved, and have been informative in defining targets downstream of mTOR that promote immune regulation. However, these studies have also presented confusing and, at times, contradictory findings, highlighting the complexities involved in examining the mTOR pathway in distinct contexts. Here, we review current understanding of the roles of mTOR in T cell biology, highlighting emerging concepts and areas of investigation where the precise role of mTOR has yet to be fully discerned.|Non-Cancer
ID:25537430|Title:4D co-registration of X-ray and MR-mammograms: initial clinical results and potential incremental diagnostic value.Abstract:PURPOSE: 4D co-registration of X-ray- and MR-mammograms (XM and MM) is a new method of image fusion. The present study aims to evaluate its clinical feasibility, radiological accuracy, and potential clinical value. METHODS: XM and MM of 25 patients were co-registered. Results were evaluated by a blinded reader. RESULTS: Precision of the 4D co-registration was "very good" (mean-score [ms]=7), and lesions were "easier to delineate" (ms=5). In 88.8%, "relevant additional diagnostic information" was present, accounting for a more "confident diagnosis" in 76% (ms=5). CONCLUSION: 4D co-registration is feasible, accurate, and of potential clinical value.|Non-Cancer
ID:25557241|Title:Outcomes of preimplantation genetic diagnosis in neurofibromatosis type 1.Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of patient and facility level factors on the success of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Large PGD reference laboratory. PATIENT(S): All patients with NF1 referred from June 2004 to May 2013. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Embryos' NF1 mutation status and live birth rates. RESULT(S): Seventy-seven couples underwent 156 PGD cycles during the study period. The average maternal age at the time of embryo biopsy was 33.2 years. The majority of embryos had a day 3 single blastomere biopsy without aneuploidy screening. A diagnosis was obtained for 80% of biopsied embryos; 20% of biopsies were nondiagnostic due to technical failures. Diagnosis was more often obtained for embryos of parents with familial disease and for embryos biopsied at centers that referred multiple NF1 cases. Among diagnosed embryos, 483/1,060 (46%) were unaffected by the parental NF1 mutation. Twenty-two (14%) of the 156 cycles had a confirmed live birth; if the observed success rate is applied to cycles with unknown outcomes, 33/156 (21%) cycles are expected to have resulted in live birth. In multivariate logistic regression, having a live birth was significantly associated with having more unaffected embryos available for transfer (odds ratio 1.33 per additional embryo, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.72). CONCLUSION(S): Advances in biopsy and diagnostic techniques which increase the number of unaffected embryos identified may improve live birth rates for patients with NF1. Clinicians should counsel patients about their fertility and reproductive options early, with the use of disease-specific data, to set appropriate expectations for the PGD process.|Non-Cancer
ID:25578100|Title:Risk factors for anaphylaxis in patients with mastocytosis.Abstract:INTRODUCTION: Symptoms resulting from the activation and release of mediators from the mast cells are observed in about 30% of the patients with mastocytosis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of anaphylactic reactions and to identify the risk factors for anaphylaxis in patients with mastocytosis depending on the type of the disease. Furthermore, we analyzed a response to treatment of mediator-related symptoms in this patient group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group included 152 adult patients with mastocytosis. The diagnostic workup included a histopathological examination, flow cytometry, KIT mutation analysis, and measurement of tryptase levels. The diagnosis of allergy was confirmed by the skin prick test and serum immunoglobulin E levels. RESULTS: The prevalence of anaphylactic reactions in the study group was 50% and was higher in patients with systemic mastocytosis (P = 0.007), specifically in its indolent variant (P = 0.026), than in patients with cutaneous mastocytosis. The most frequent triggers of anaphylaxis were food (29%), insect stings (22%), and drugs (15%). Tryptase levels were higher in patients with a history of anaphylaxis (P = 0.029) as well as in those with symptoms provoked by physical factors (P = 0.002). Such symptoms were reported in 112 patients (74%) and were more common in patients with systemic mastocytosis compared with those with cutaneous mastocytosis (P = 0.026). The treatment was ineffective in 8 patients (10.5%) and resulted only in partial remission in 14 patients (18.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The study showed a significant incidence of symptoms related to physical factors in patients with mastocytosis and anaphylaxis in history. Risk factors for anaphylaxis included increased serum tryptase levels and indolent variant of systemic mastocytosis. Standard pharmacological treatment was ineffective in 10% of the patients, who may require biological treatment.|Non-Cancer
ID:25582384|Title:The impact of sensitive KIT D816V detection on recognition of indolent Systemic Mastocytosis.Abstract:Patients with Systemic Mastocytosis (SM) need a highly sensitive diagnostic test for D816V detection of the KIT receptor gene. Along with histology/cytology and flow cytometry evaluation, bone marrow (BM) from 110 consecutive adult patients referred with a suspicion of SM to Multidisciplinary Outpatient Clinic for Mastocytosis in Verona were tested both by Amplification Refractory Mutation System Reverse Transcriptase quantitative real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (ARMS-RT-qPCR) and RT-PCR+Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) followed by Denaturing-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (D-HPLC) and Sanger sequencing. ARMS-RT-qPCR identified D816V mutation in 77 patients, corresponding to 100% of cases showing CD25(+) mast cells (MCs) whereas RT-PCR+RFLP/D-HPLC+sequencing revealed D816V mutations in 47 patients. According to the 2008 WHO criteria 75 SM, 1 Cutaneous Mastocytosis (CM), 1 monoclonal MC activation syndrome (MMAS), and 1 SM Associated with Haematologic Non-Mast Cell Disorder (SM-AHNMD) were diagnosed. Seventeen out 75 SM patients (23%) would have not satisfied sufficient WHO criteria on the basis of the sole RT-PCR+RFLP: these patients had significantly lower serum tryptase levels and amount of CD25(+) MCs. Therefore, ARMS-RT-qPCR might result particularly useful, in patients that do not fulfil major BM histological criterion, for the recognition of indolent SM with a very low MC burden.|Non-Cancer
ID:25586219|Title:53BP1 promotes microhomology-mediated end-joining in G1-phase cells.Abstract:Alternative non-homologous end joining (alt-NHEJ) was originally identified as a backup repair mechanism in the absence of classical NHEJ (c-NHEJ) factors but recent studies have demonstrated that alt-NHEJ is active even when c-NHEJ as well as homologous recombination is available. The functions of 53BP1 in NHEJ processes are not well understood. Here, we report that 53BP1 promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and genomic stability not only in c-NHEJ-proficient but also -deficient human G1-phase cells. Using an array of repair substrates we show that these effects of 53BP1 are correlated with a promotion of microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), a subtype of alt-NHEJ, in G1-phase. Consistent with a specific role in MMEJ we confirm that 53BP1 status does not affect c-NHEJ. 53BP1 supports sequence deletion during MMEJ consistent with a putative role in facilitating end-resection. Interestingly, promotion of MMEJ by 53BP1 in G1-phase cells is only observed in the presence of functional BRCA1. Depletion of both 53BP1 and BRCA1 increases repair needing microhomology usage and augments loss of DNA sequence, suggesting that MMEJ is a highly regulated DSB repair process. Together, these findings significantly expand our understanding of the cell-cycle-dependent roles of 53BP1 in DSB repair.|Non-Cancer
ID:25600436|Title:Identification of chimeric antigen receptors that mediate constitutive or inducible proliferation of T cells.Abstract:This study compared second-generation chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) encoding signaling domains composed of CD28, ICOS, and 4-1BB (TNFRSF9). Here, we report that certain CARs endow T cells with the ability to undergo long-term autonomous proliferation. Transduction of primary human T cells with lentiviral vectors encoding some of the CARs resulted in sustained proliferation for up to 3 months following a single stimulation through the T-cell receptor (TCR). Sustained numeric expansion was independent of cognate antigen and did not require the addition of exogenous cytokines or feeder cells after a single stimulation of the TCR and CD28. Results from gene array and functional assays linked sustained cytokine secretion and expression of T-bet (TBX21), EOMES, and GATA-3 to the effect. Sustained expression of the endogenous IL2 locus has not been reported in primary T cells. Sustained proliferation was dependent on CAR structure and high expression, the latter of which was necessary but not sufficient. The mechanism involves constitutive signaling through NF-kappaB, AKT, ERK, and NFAT. The propagated CAR T cells retained a diverse TCR repertoire, and cellular transformation was not observed. The CARs with a constitutive growth phenotype displayed inferior antitumor effects and engraftment in vivo. Therefore, the design of CARs that have a nonconstitutive growth phenotype may be a strategy to improve efficacy and engraftment of CAR T cells. The identification of CARs that confer constitutive or nonconstitutive growth patterns may explain observations that CAR T cells have differential survival patterns in clinical trials.|Non-Cancer
ID:25612910|Title:Evaluation of somatic mutations in tibial pseudarthrosis samples in neurofibromatosis type 1.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Tibial pseudarthrosis is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and there is wide clinical variability of the tibial dysplasia in NF1, suggesting the possibility of genetic modifiers. Double inactivation of NF1 is postulated to be necessary for the development of tibial pseudarthrosis, but tissue or cell of origin of the 'second hit' mutation remains unclear. METHODS: Exome sequencing of different sections of surgically resected NF1 tibial pseudarthrosis tissue was performed and compared to germline (peripheral blood). RESULTS: A germline NF1 splice site mutation (c.61-2A>T, p.L21 M68del) was identified from DNA extracted from peripheral blood. Exome sequencing of DNA extracted from tissue removed during surgery of the tibial pseudarthrosis showed a somatic mutation of NF1 (c.3574G>T, p.E1192*) in the normal germline allele. Further analysis of different regions of the tibial pseudarthrosis sample showed enrichment of the somatic mutation in the soft tissue within the pseudarthrosis site and absence of the somatic mutation in cortical bone. In addition, a germline variant in PTPN11 (c.1658C>T, p.T553M), a gene involved in the RAS signal transduction pathway was identified, although the clinical significance is unknown. CONCLUSIONS: Given that the NF1 somatic mutation was primarily detected in the proliferative soft tissue at the pseudarthrosis site, it is likely that the second hit occurred in mesenchymal progenitors from the periosteum. These results are consistent with a defect of differentiation, which may explain why the mutation is found in proliferative cells and not within cortical bone tissue, as the latter by definition contains mostly mature differentiated osteoblasts and osteocytes.|Non-Cancer
ID:25623620|Title:Hypogammaglobulinemia in children after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a cytokine mediated immunoglobulin isotype class switch arrest?Abstract:BACKGROUND: Hypogammaglobulinemia (hypo-IgG) is common early post-HSCT in children, occasionally necessitating long-term immunoglobulin (Ig) G replacement therapy. IgG replacement may not reduce mortality, although infectious complications are decreased PROCEDURE: Clinical data and samples from 86 children were analyzed retrospectively with the aim to identify risk factors for developing long-term hypo-IgG (i.e., requiring >= 3 months IgG replacement) post-HSCT and studying the underlying biology. Laboratory studies covered serum cytokines, IGHG2 genotyping and routine laboratory investigations. Results were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent of the children developed long-term hypo-IgG. These children were younger (<5 years) and had higher acute GvHD incidence, but had better overall survival (88% vs. 69%, P = 0.036). Significantly lower Ig levels post-HSCT but equal immune cell recovery were seen in patients with long-term hypo-IgG compared with those of transient or no hypo-IgG. Pre-HSCT IL-6 and -7 and post-HSCT BAFF and APRIL levels were significantly higher in the long-term hypo-IgG group. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggests an unfavorable cytokine milieu for graft-derived immune recovery, possibly inducing Ig isotype class switch arrest. Younger age, acute GvHD, and higher pre-HSCT IL-6 levels were identified as significant risk factors for long-term hypo-IgG. Long-term hypo-IgG post-HSCT does not need to be unfavorable and could be an effect of deteriorated cytokine signaling.|Non-Cancer
ID:25637637|Title:Proteins of the mitotic checkpoint and spindle are related to chromosomal instability and unfavourable prognosis in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.Abstract:AIMS: To study the immunoexpression of proteins related to the mitotic checkpoint (cell division cycle 20 (CDC20), mitotic arrest deficient 2 (MAD2)) and the mitotic spindle (Aurora-B) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). METHODS: Protein expression was analysed in bone marrow tissue samples from 40 patients with MDS using immunohistochemistry. Prognostic markers (transfusion dependency, depth of cytopenias, chromosomal abnormalities and survival) were also studied. RESULTS: Higher MAD2 expression was observed among patients with platelets <50x10(9)/L than among patients with platelets >=50x10(9)/L (42.6+-22.8% vs 22.7+-19.1%, respectively). Higher CDC20 expression was identified among patients with three dysplasias compared with patients who presented with one or two dysplasias (33.9+-24.1% vs 10.5+-5.7% vs 12.8+-7.8%, respectively), among patients who exhibited a complex versus non-complex karyotype (50.0+-30.2% vs 18.4+-14%, respectively) and among patients with platelets <50x10(9)/L vs platelets >=50x10(9)/L (38.2+-26.2% vs 16.1+-12.4%, respectively). Higher Aurora-B expression was found in patients with an abnormal versus normal karyotype (21.2+-13.2% vs 7.5+-5.0%, respectively). High expression of MAD2 and CDC20 (>=50%) was associated with severe thrombocytopenia. We also found statistically significant differences in the overall survival rate when comparing different degrees of CDC20, MAD2 and Aurora-B protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that these proteins are associated with chromosomal abnormalities and poor prognosis in patients with MDS.|Non-Cancer
ID:25659728|Title:Mutational profiling in patients with MDS: ready for every-day use in the clinic?Abstract:Multiple recurrent somatic mutations were identified in the majority of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), but investigating the broad spectrum of molecular markers in MDS exceeds many laboratories' capacity when traditional molecular techniques are used. High-throughput second generation sequencing (=next-generation sequencing, NGS) has proven to be applicable for comprehensive biomarker mutation analyses allowing to increase diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy and to improve risk stratification and prognostication in addition to cytomorphology and cytogenetic analysis in patients with MDS. Amplicon deep-sequencing enables comprehensive biomarker analysis in a multitude of patients per investigation in an acceptable turn-around time and at affordable costs. Comprehensive myeloid marker panels were successfully introduced into diagnostic practice. Therefore, molecular mutation analysis is ready for use in all patients with suspected MDS, may contribute to risk stratification in possible candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and should become an integral part of clinical research studies in MDS patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:25662299|Title:Paediatric mastocytosis: a systematic review of 1747 cases.Abstract:Paediatric mastocytosis was previously considered to be a benign and spontaneously regressing disease. However, this evolution is impossible to predict. To clarify the characteristics and course of paediatric mastocytosis, we performed a literature review of 1747 cases published between 1950 and April 2014. Lesions occurred before the age of 2 years in 90% of cases, and presented as urticaria pigmentosa (75% of cases), mastocytoma (20%) or diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (5%). The male-to-female ratio was 1 4. KIT D816V mutation was detected in 34% of 215 tested patients. Clinical regression (complete or partial) occurred in 67% of cases and stabilization in 27%. However, the outcome was fatal in 2 9% of patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:25663681|Title:CD4+ T cell STAT3 phosphorylation precedes acute GVHD, and subsequent Th17 tissue invasion correlates with GVHD severity and therapeutic response.Abstract:Th17 cells contribute to severe GVHD in murine bone marrow transplantation. Targeted deletion of the RORgammat transcription factor or blockade of the JAK2-STAT3 axis suppresses IL-17 production and alloreactivity by Th17 cells. Here, we show that pSTAT3 Y705 is increased significantly in CD4(+) T cells among human recipients of allogeneic HCT before the onset of Grade II-IV acute GVHD. Examination of target-organ tissues at the time of GVHD diagnosis indicates that the amount of RORgammat + Th17 cells is significantly higher in severe GVHD. Greater accumulation of tissue-resident Th17 cells also correlates with the use of MTX- compared with Rapa-based GVHD prophylaxis, as well as a poor therapeutic response to glucocorticoids. RORgammat is optimally suppressed by concurrent neutralization of TORC1 with Rapa and inhibition of STAT3 activation with S3I-201, supporting that mTOR- and STAT3-dependent pathways converge upon RORgammat gene expression. Rapa-resistant T cell proliferation can be totally inhibited by STAT3 blockade during initial allosensitization. We conclude that STAT3 signaling and resultant Th17 tissue accumulation are closely associated with acute GVHD onset, severity, and treatment outcome. Future studies are needed to validate the association of STAT3 activity in acute GVHD. Novel GVHD prevention strategies that incorporate dual STAT3 and mTOR inhibition merit investigation.|Non-Cancer
ID:25667416|Title:Immunodeficiency and autoimmune enterocolopathy linked to NFAT5 haploinsufficiency.Abstract:The link between autoimmune diseases and primary immunodeficiency syndromes has been increasingly appreciated. Immunologic evaluation of a young man with autoimmune enterocolopathy and unexplained infections revealed evidence of immunodeficiency, including IgG subclass deficiency, impaired Ag-induced lymphocyte proliferation, reduced cytokine production by CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and decreased numbers of NK cells. Genetic evaluation identified haploinsufficiency of NFAT5, a transcription factor regulating immune cell function and cellular adaptation to hyperosmotic stress, as a possible cause of this syndrome. Inhibition or deletion of NFAT5 in normal human and murine cells recapitulated several of the immune deficits identified in the patient. These results provide evidence of a primary immunodeficiency disorder associated with organ-specific autoimmunity linked to NFAT5 deficiency.|Non-Cancer
ID:25727006|Title:CENP-A K124 Ubiquitylation Is Required for CENP-A Deposition at the Centromere.Abstract:CENP-A is a centromere-specific histone H3 variant that epigenetically determines centromere identity to ensure kinetochore assembly and proper chromosome segregation, but the precise mechanism of its specific localization within centromeric heterochromatin remains obscure. We have discovered that CUL4A-RBX1-COPS8 E3 ligase activity is required for CENP-A ubiquitylation on lysine 124 (K124) and CENP-A centromere localization. A mutation of CENP-A, K124R, reduces interaction with HJURP (a CENP-A-specific histone chaperone) and abrogates localization of CENP-A to the centromere. Addition of monoubiquitin is sufficient to restore CENP-A K124R to centromeres and the interaction with HJURP, indicating that "signaling" ubiquitylation is required for CENP-A loading at centromeres. The CUL4A-RBX1 complex is required for loading newly synthesized CENP-A and maintaining preassembled CENP-A at centromeres. Thus, CENP-A K124R ubiquitylation, mediated by the CUL4A-RBX1-COPS8 complex, is essential for CENP-A deposition at the centromere.|Non-Cancer
ID:25741140|Title:Screening analysis of candidate gene mutations in a kindred with polycystic liver disease.Abstract:AIM: To find potential mutable sites by detecting mutations of the candidate gene in a kindred with polycystic liver disease (PCLD). METHODS: First, we chose a kindred with PCLD and obtained five venous blood samples of this kindred after the family members signed the informed consent form. In the kindred two cases were diagnosed with PCLD, and the left three cases were normal individuals. All the blood samples were preserved at -85  C. Second, we extracted the genomic DNA from the venous blood samples of the kindred using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit and then performed long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with different primers. The exons of PKD1 were all sequenced with the forward and reverse primers to ensure the accuracy of the results. Next, we purified the PCR products and directly sequenced them using Big Dye Terminator Chemistry version 3.1. The sequencing reaction was conducted with BiomekFX (Beckman). Finally, we analyzed the results. RESULTS: A total of 42 normal exons were identified in detecting mutations of the PKD1 gene. A synonymous mutation occurred in exon 5. The mutation was a homozygous T in the proband and was C in the reference sequence. This mutation was located in the third codon and did not change the amino acid encoded by the codon. Missense mutations occurred in exons 11 and 35. These mutations were located in the second codon; they changed the amino acid sequence and existed in the dbSNP library. A nonsense mutation occurred in exon 15. The mutation was a heterozygous CT in the proband and was C in the reference sequence. This mutation was located in the first codon and resulted in a termination codon. This mutation had an obvious influence on the encoded protein and changed the length of the protein from 4303 to 2246 amino acids. This was a new mutation that was not present in the dbSNP library. CONCLUSION: The nonsense mutation of exon 15 existed in the proband and in the third individual. Additionally, the proband was heterozygous for this mutation, so the mutable site was a pathogenic mutation.|Non-Cancer
ID:25759145|Title:ATM gene single nucleotide polymorphisms predict regimen-related gastrointestinal toxicity in patients allografted after reduced conditioning.Abstract:Polymorphisms of genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity have become an object of major interest in regard to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) complications. Regimen-related gastrointestinal toxicity (RR-GIT) is the dominant complication during the pre-engraftment period and has been linked to increased risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) development. According to our hypothesis, functional variants of genes participating in DNA damage response (DDR) may have an impact on the extent of tissue damage caused by the conditioning regimen. In our single-center study, we analyzed 62 patients who underwent HSCT from HLA-identical donors after reduced conditioning. The patients were genotyped for 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs4585 T/G, rs189037 A/G, rs227092 T/G, rs228590 C/T, and rs664677 T/C) of the ATM gene-the essential member of the DDR pathways, using allele-specific matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry assay. Because of almost absolute linkage disequilibrium observed among all 5 SNPs, association of 2 major ATM haplotypes (ATM1/ATM2) with RR-GIT and acute GVHD (aGVHD) was analyzed. Importantly, the univariate and multivariate analysis showed that patients homozygous for ATM2 haplotype (rs4585*T, rs189037*A, rs227092*T, rs228590*C, and rs664677*T) are more likely to suffer from high-grade RR-GIT than ATM1 homozygous patients. The association with aGVHD was not significant. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the ATM gene variability in relation to RR-GIT in the allogeneic HSCT setting.|Non-Cancer
ID:25780857|Title:Evaluation of von Willebrand factor phenotypes and genotypes in Hemophilia A patients with and without identified F8 mutations.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in factor VIII (FVIII). von Willebrand disease (VWD) is characterized by a quantitative or qualitative defect in von Willebrand factor (VWF). Patients with VWD with severely low VWF or VWD Type 2N (VWD2N), a VWD subtype distinguished by defective VWF binding to FVIII, may have reduced FVIII levels secondary to their VWD. These patients superficially resemble patients with HA and pose a potential for misdiagnosis. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the unexplained cause of bleeding in HA patients without known FVIII mutations by assessing plasma VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), FVIII binding capacities and VWF genotypes. PATIENTS/METHODS: Thirty-seven of 1027 patients with HA studied as part of the Hemophilia Inhibitor Research Study lacked identifiable F8 mutations. These patients (cases) and 73 patients with identified F8 mutations (controls) were evaluated for VWF:Ag, a patient's VWF capacity to bind FVIII (VWF:FVIIIB) and VWF sequence. RESULTS: Four cases had VWF:Ag < 3 IU dL(-1) and VWF mutations consistent with Type 3 VWD. Six cases and one control were heterozygous for mutations previously reported to cause Type 1 VWD (VWD1) (n = five cases and one control) or predicted to be deleterious by Polyphen2 and SIFT prediction tools (n = 1 case). One control had VWF:Ag < 30 IU dL(-1) and seven patients (four cases and three controls), including two cases who were heterozygous for a known VWD2N mutation, had reduced VWF:FVIIIB. CONCLUSIONS: These data emphasize that some patients diagnosed with HA require VWF assessments in order to achieve a comprehensive diagnosis and an optimal treatment strategy.|Non-Cancer
ID:25824806|Title:Clinical and laboratory characterization of 114 cases of Castleman disease patients from a single centre: paraneoplastic pemphigus is an unfavourable prognostic factor.Abstract:This study retrospectively collected the clinical and laboratory data of 114 patients with Castleman disease (CD) from a single medical centre. Clinical classification identified 62 patients (54 4%) with unicentric Castleman disease and 52 (45 6%) with multi-centric Castleman disease. Pathological classification revealed 68 cases (59 6%) of hyaline vascular variant, 16 (14 1%) mixed cellular variant (Mix) and 30 (26 3%) plasmacytic variant. Clinical complications occurred in 69 CD patients, including 37 cases of paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) and 25 cases with renal complications. Haematological involvement, pleural effusion and/or ascites and POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes) were also found. Univariate analysis showed that presence of clinical complications and PNP were both risk factors relating to CD patient survival. Prognostic factors showing P < 0 15 in univariate analysis and those with clinical significance were subjected to multivariate analysis using a Cox regression model. PNP presence and age over 40 years both significantly adversely affected survival. Thus, only presence of PNP was identified as an independent unfavourable survival risk factor in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Overall, the present data provide a panoramic description of CD cases and emphasize that the presence of PNP is an adverse prognostic factor.|Non-Cancer
ID:25833810|Title:Activation of KIT modulates the function of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL-R) in mast cells.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is characterized by the accumulation of mast cells (MCs) associated with activating mutations of KIT. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors (TRAIL-Rs) are preferentially expressed on neoplastic cells and induce the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Recent studies reported on the expression of TRAIL-Rs and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cultured human MCs, which depend on stem cell factor (SCF)-induced or constitutive KIT activation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We sought to further define the impact of TRAIL-Rs on MCs in vivo and in vitro. Using Cre/loxP recombination, we generated mice with MC-specific and ubiquitous knockout of TRAIL-R. In these mice, anaphylaxis and numbers of MCs were investigated. We also explored the expression and function of TRAIL-Rs in cultured murine and human MCs upon activation of KIT. By conducting immunofluorescence staining, we analyzed the expression of TRAIL-Rs in MCs infiltrating the bone marrow of patients with mastocytosis. RESULTS: MC-specific deletion of TRAIL-R was associated with a slight, but significant increase in anaphylaxis. Numbers of MCs in MC-specific knockouts of TRAIL-R were comparable to controls. Whereas cultured IL-3-dependent murine MCs from wild-type mice were resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, SCF-stimulated MCs underwent apoptosis in response to TRAIL. Interestingly, activating KIT mutations also promoted sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in human MCs. In line with these findings, MCs infiltrating the bone marrow of patients with mastocytosis expressed TRAIL-R1. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of KIT regulates the function of TRAIL-Rs in MCs. TRAIL-R1 may represent an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic target in diseases associated with KIT mutations, such as mastocytosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:25837692|Title:The clinical and laboratory evaluation of the patient with erythrocytosis.Abstract:Erythrocytosis is frequently encountered as an incidental abnormality on laboratory testing that reveals persistent elevation of the hematocrit level (>52% in men and >48% in women). In many cases, erythrocytosis is the manifestation of an underlying cardiopulmonary process, drug-induced due to androgens, or secondary to smoking, rather than a primary bone marrow disorder such as polycythemia vera. A systematic approach to the clinical and laboratory evaluation of each patient is indicated to consider diverse differential diagnosis possibilities and to identify the underlying etiology of erythrocytosis in order to formulate appropriate subspecialist referral and management plans. A thorough medical history and meticulous physical examination supplemented by a focused initial laboratory evaluation will enable the general practitioner to ascertain the etiology of erythrocytosis in the majority of cases. Patients with clinical and laboratory features suggestive of polycythemia vera and those patients without an apparent underlying condition known to cause erythrocytosis benefit from early referral to a hematologist for further specialized diagnostic evaluation and therapy considerations.|Non-Cancer
ID:25853332|Title:APOL1 toxin, innate immunity, and kidney injury.Abstract:The discovery that two common APOL1 alleles were strongly associated with nondiabetic kidney diseases in African descent populations led to hope for improved diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, we still do not have a clear understanding of the biological function played by APOL1 in podocytes or other kidney cells, nor how the renal risk alleles initiate the development of nephropathies. Important clues for APOL1 function may be gleaned from the natural defense mechanism of APOL1 against trypanosome infections and from similar proteins (e.g., diphtheria toxin, mammalian Bcl-2 family members). This review provides an update on the biological functions for circulating (trypanosome resistance) and intracellular (emerging role for autophagy) APOL1. Further, we introduce a multimer model for APOL1 in kidney cells that reconciles the gain-of-function variants with the recessive inheritance pattern of APOL1 renal risk alleles.|Non-Cancer
ID:25858055|Title:Anaphylaxis after hymenoptera sting: is it venom allergy, a clonal disorder, or both?Abstract:A 47-year-old man presented with loss of consciousness 5 minutes after being stung by a yellow jacket in his backyard. Epinephrine and fluids were required for resuscitation. Allergy evaluation revealed specific IgE to yellow jacket and honeybee, and the patient was started on venom immunotherapy. He had systemic reactions during buildup and a severe anaphylactic episode requiring 3 doses of intramuscular epinephrine at maintenance doses. Immunotherapy was discontinued. Serum tryptase level after 1 such episode was 29 ng/mL, with a baseline level of 25 ng/mL 4 weeks later. The physical examination was unremarkable including no skin lesions of cutaneous mastocytosis. Because of elevated baseline tryptase level, a bone marrow biopsy was performed, which revealed multifocal dense infiltrates of mast cells. A diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis was made. The patient was treated with omalizumab and was able to tolerate immunotherapy and is currently maintained on lifelong immunotherapy. He was restung in the field and has not had anaphylaxis.|Non-Cancer
ID:25862606|Title:Simultaneous assessment of NF-kappaB/p65 phosphorylation and nuclear localization using imaging flow cytometry.Abstract:Aberrant activity of Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is associated with many diseases and is therapeutically targeted. Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation of the RELA/p65 sub-unit, are essential for cytoplasmic to nuclear localization of NF-kappaB/p65 and initiation of transcription of downstream target genes. Immunoblot and phospho-flow cytometry have been used to study the relationship between phosphorylation motifs and NF-kappaB activation and microscopic analysis of nuclear localization of p65 is also used as a parameter for activation. The labor intensive nature of these approaches commonly limits the number of sampling points or replicates. Recent insights into the relationship between p65 phosphorylation motifs and their nuclear localization indicate that these parameters have different significances and should not be used interchangeably. In this study, we demonstrate feasibility and reproducibility of studying the relationship between p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation using imaging flow cytometry (IFC). TNFalpha- or PMA/Ionomycin-induced phosphorylation of p65 at serine 529 in cell line models and healthy donor lymphocytes served as the experimental model. IFC analysis demonstrated that expression of phosphorylated serine 529 (P-p65(s529)) increased rapidly following stimulation and that nuclear localization of P-p65(s529) followed the nuclear localization pattern of total p65. However, in the presence of tacrolimus, P-p65(s529) expression was inhibited without affecting nuclear localization of total p65. The data demonstrate the application of IFC to simultaneously assess phosphorylation of p65 and its cellular localization and the results obtained by this analysis corroborate current insights regarding the specific effect of tacrolimus on serine 529 phosphorylation.|Non-Cancer
ID:25899109|Title:Anaphylaxis with clonal mast cells in normal looking skin - a new entity?Abstract:BACKGROUND: Patients with elevated basal tryptase (sBT) >15 mug/l and anaphylaxis may have an underlying mastocytosis. A monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome with aberrant mast cells (MC) at extracutaneous sites has been described in patients with severe hypotension or anaphylaxis. METHODS: As MC in patients with elevated sBT might be altered in the skin as well, we studied MC in normal neck skin in anaphylaxis and urticaria patients with elevated sBT. RESULTS: A mean of 93.1 (SD 19.1) MC/mm2 was counted in normal neck skin in 14 patients with anaphylaxis, 84.0 (SD 13.6) in seven patients with urticaria, 142.0 (SD 24.0) in two patients with eczema, 124.4 (SD 43.2) in five patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) in comparison with autopsy skin (39.1 MC/mm2, SD 12.4). In five of 14 (35.7%) of the anaphylaxis and three of five (60%) SM patients more than 25% of MC were spindle shaped and expressed CD25 antigen. CONCLUSIONS: We could show for the first time that the normal skin can harbour clonal MC in anaphylaxis patients. Analogous to the criteria for mastocytosis, we suggest a skin score criteria including an elevated number of MC, spindle shape, CD25 expression, c-Kit mutation and sBT values >20 mug/l. In patients with anaphylaxis and elevated sBT, skin should be biopsied and, as with the approach for mastocytosis diagnosis in the bone marrow, MC should be analysed for their number, clonality and c-Kit mutation. This approach should be confirmed in further studies. Patients with aberrant skin MC should be handled as mastocytosis patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:25911850|Title:Analysis of oxidative stress status through MN test and serum MDA levels in PCOS women.Abstract:Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a multifactorial reproductive healthcare problem affecting 4-12% of women and a leading cause of female infertility worldwide. The potential genetic contributors of PCOS are unclear. However, over the past decade emerging evidence has shown that increased Oxidative Stress (OS) and decreased antioxidant status were often linked with PCOS. The present case-control study was aimed to assess the reactive oxygen species induced OS in women from South India. A total of 164 individuals comprising of 89 patients and 75 controls were enrolled in the present study. For all the subjects, the frequency of micronucleated cells (MNC) in epithelial samples and serum Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were estimated to assess genomic instability and cytotoxicity respectively. A statistically significant difference between the groups were identified with respect to Body Mass Index, Waist to Hip Ratio, luteinizing hormone and prolactin levels (< 0.05), however the mean follicle stimulating hormone was not different between the groups (p = 0.055). The frequency of MN cells (5.89 +- 4.86 vs. 2.24 +- 2.01) and mean serum MDA (360.84 +- 87.08 vs. 301.70 +- 82.82) levels were considerably higher in patients than controls (p = < 0.0001), furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between MNC and MDA levels in patients (r = 0.349, p = 0.0008) and not in controls (r = 0.104, p = 0.37), suggest high OS in PCOS women. Therefore, MN assay and serum MDA levels may serve together or individually as biomarkers of OS in PCOS women.|Non-Cancer
ID:25923088|Title:Porphobilinogen deaminase gene mutations in Polish patients with non-erythroid acute intermittent porphyria.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an metabolic disorder characterized by a partial deficiency of the porphobilinogen deaminase, the enzyme of heme biosynthesis. The metabolic defect in AIP involves an approximately half-normal activity of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD, EC 4.3.1.8), the enzyme catalyzing condensation of four porphobilinogen molecules to hydroxymethylbilane. Due to tissue-specific alternative transcript splicing, the PBGD gene mutations within the range of exons 3-15 may lead to classical AIP involving erythrocytes and all the other tissues. Mutations within intron and exon 1 may result in the so-called non-erythroid AIP in which the PBGD activity is normal in erythrocytes and diminished in other tissues. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to characterise molecular errors in the PBGD gene in Polish patients with non-erythroid AIP and to evaluate the efficacy of the DNA sequencing method in the early diagnosis of this disorder. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty five members of nine non-erythroid AIP families were assessed. In each of them DNA sequencing was performed using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v.1.1 on the Hitachi 3730 Analyzer (Applied Biosystem, USA). RESULTS: Four mutations were detected in intron 1 of the PBGD gene, including one unreported novel mutation, 33+(4-12) del AGTGCTGAG, of an unknown biological mechanism, and three previously described mutations, i.e. 33+1 G > A, 33+2 T > C, 33+5 G > C, responsible for abnormal transcript splicing in the area of exon 1. Of 14 asymptomatic members of proband families in 6 subjects were diagnosed with AIP, and in 8 the AIP was excluded based on the DNA sequencing method. CONCLUSIONS: DNA sequencing based analysis is the only reliable method for correct diagnosis of asymptomatic non-erythroid AIP patients with normal urinary excretion of heme precursors. The mutations found in Polish patients with non-erythroid AIP represented those of splice defect and resulted in abnormal exon 1 splicing.|Non-Cancer
ID:25924711|Title:High genetic risk individuals benefit less from resistance exercise intervention.Abstract:OBJECTIVES: Genetic factors have an important role in body mass index (BMI) variation, and also likely have a role in the weight loss and body composition response to physical activity/exercise. With the recent identification of BMI-associated genetic variants, it is possible to investigate the interaction of these genetic factors with exercise on body composition outcomes. METHODS: In a block-randomized clinical trial of resistance exercise among women (n=148), we examined whether the putative effect of exercise on weight and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-derived body composition measurements differs according to genetic risk for obesity. Approximately one-half of the sample was randomized to an intervention consisting of a supervised, intensive, resistance exercise program, lasting 1 year. Genetic risk for obesity was defined as a genetic risk score (GRS) comprised of 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with BMI variation. We examined the interaction of exercise intervention and the GRS on anthropometric and body composition measurements after 1 year of the exercise intervention. RESULTS: We found statistically significant interactions for body weight (P=0.01), body fat (P=0.01), body fat % (P=0.02) and abdominal fat (P=0.02), whereby the putative effect of exercise is greater among those with a lower level of genetic risk for obesity. No single SNP appears to be a major driver of these interactions. CONCLUSIONS: The weight-loss response to resistance exercise, including changes in body composition, differs according to an individual's genetic risk for obesity.|Non-Cancer
ID:25934766|Title:Analysis of phenotype and outcome in essential thrombocythemia with CALR or JAK2 mutations.Abstract:The JAK2 V617F mutation, the thrombopoietin receptor MPL W515K/L mutation and calreticulin (CALR) mutations are mutually exclusive in essential thrombocythemia and support a novel molecular categorization of essential thrombocythemia. CALR mutations account for approximately 30% of cases of essential thrombocythemia. In a retrospective study, we examined the frequency of MPL and CALR mutations in JAK2 V617F-negative cases of essential thrombocythemia (n=103). In addition, we compared the clinical phenotype and outcome of CALR mutant cases of essential thrombocythemia with a cohort of JAK2 V617F-positive essential thrombocythemia (n=57). CALR-positive cases represented 63.7% of double-negative cases of essential thrombocythemia, and most carried CALR type 1 or type 2 indels. However, we also identified one patient who was positive for both the JAK2 V617F and the CALR mutations. This study revealed that CALR mutant essential thrombocythemia is associated with younger age, higher platelet counts, lower erythrocyte counts, leukocyte counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, and increased risk of progression to myelofibrosis in comparison with JAK2 V617F-positive essential thrombocythemia. Analysis of the CALR mutant group according to indel type showed that CALR type 1 deletion is strongly associated with male gender. CALR mutant patients had a better overall survival than JAK2 V617F-positive patients, in particular patients of age 60 years or younger. In conclusion, this study in a Belgian cohort of patients supports and extends the growing body of evidence that CALR mutant cases of essential thrombocythemia are phenotypically distinct from JAK2 V617F-positive cases, with regards to clinical and hematologic presentation as well as overall survival.|Non-Cancer
ID:25936905|Title:Evaluation of Posterior Hippocampal Epileptogenicity During Epilepsy Surgery For Temporal Lobe Cavernoma by the Occipital Approach.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Cavernomas frequently are associated with intractable epilepsy. When cavernomas located in the temporal lobe are associated with intractable epilepsy, the hippocampus also may have an epileptic focus. The objective in the present study was to clarify the importance of evaluation of the posterior hippocampal epileptogenicity during epilepsy surgery for posteromedial temporal lobe cavernoma. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: In this study, we describe 2 rare cases of medically intractable epilepsy in patients with posteromedial temporal lobe cavernomas who underwent surgery via the occipital approach. Using longitudinal insertion of depth electrodes into the hippocampus, we evaluated epileptogenicity in both patients from the cavernoma cavity and its surrounding hemosiderin, as well as from the posterior hippocampus near the cavernoma. We show that the transoccipital approach to the posteromedial temporal lobe is compatible with depth electrode insertion and subdural electrode placement on the temporal lobe, enabling an accurate evaluation of potential epileptogenic zones in the posterior part of the hippocampus. Both patients did not experience any seizures and had no postoperative neurologic deficits, and their cognitive functions were intact. CONCLUSIONS: The transoccipital approach enables the optimization of the extent of posterior hippocampectomy while avoiding unnecessary resection for seizure control. We suggest resecting the posterior part of the hippocampus in addition to the cavernoma and surrounding areas in patients with medically refractory epilepsy due to a posteromedial temporal cavernoma. Tailored systematic resection guided by intraoperative electrocorticography and electroencephalography with a depth electrode was important and necessary in the present cases.|Non-Cancer
ID:25963654|Title:Spindle Checkpoint Factors Bub1 and Bub2 Promote DNA Double-Strand Break Repair by Nonhomologous End Joining.Abstract:The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is essential for the preservation of genome integrity, as it efficiently repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Previous biochemical and genetic investigations have indicated that, despite the importance of this pathway, the entire complement of genes regulating NHEJ remains unknown. To address this, we employed a plasmid-based NHEJ DNA repair screen in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using 369 putative nonessential DNA repair-related components as queries. Among the newly identified genes associated with NHEJ deficiency upon disruption are two spindle assembly checkpoint kinases, Bub1 and Bub2. Both observation of resulting phenotypes and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Bub1 and -2, either alone or in combination with cell cycle regulators, are recruited near the DSB, where phosphorylated Rad53 or H2A accumulates. Large-scale proteomic analysis of Bub kinases phosphorylated in response to DNA damage identified previously unknown kinase substrates on Tel1 S/T-Q sites. Moreover, Bub1 NHEJ function appears to be conserved in mammalian cells. 53BP1, which influences DSB repair by NHEJ, colocalizes with human BUB1 and is recruited to the break sites. Thus, while Bub is not a core component of NHEJ machinery, our data support its dual role in mitotic exit and promotion of NHEJ repair in yeast and mammals.|Non-Cancer
ID:26001169|Title:Impaired function of bone marrow stromal cells in systemic mastocytosis.Abstract:Patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) have a wide variety of problems, including skeletal abnormalities. The disease results from a mutation of the stem cell receptor (c-kit) in mast cells and we wondered if the function of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs; also known as MSCs or mesenchymal stem cells) might be affected by the invasion of bone marrow by mutant mast cells. As expected, BMSCs from SM patients do not have a mutation in c-kit, but they proliferate poorly. In addition, while osteogenic differentiation of the BMSCs seems to be deficient, their adipogenic potential appears to be increased. Since the hematopoietic supportive abilities of BMSCs are also important, we also studied the engraftment in NSG mice of human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors, after being co-cultured with BMSCs of healthy volunteers vs. BMSCs derived from patients with SM. BMSCs derived from the bone marrow of patients with SM could not support hematopoiesis to the extent that healthy BMSCs do. Finally, we performed an expression analysis and found significant differences between healthy and SM derived BMSCs in the expression of genes with a variety of functions, including the WNT signaling, ossification, and bone remodeling. We suggest that some of the symptoms associated with SM might be driven by epigenetic changes in BMSCs caused by dysfunctional mast cells in the bone marrow of the patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:26008683|Title:Costotransverse screw fixation in a severe cervicothoracic deformity because of a type 1 neurofibromatosis: case report.Abstract:BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Spinal implant placement may be challenging in cases of severe cervicothoracic spinal deformities and anatomical anomalies as in Type 1 neurofibromatosis. Intralaminar screwing of the thoracic spine has been described in few cases in which pedicles were hypoplasic. The costovertebral joints have never been used before as an anchorage point for screws. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to describe a new thoracic fixation technique to be used in severe deformities whenever the posterior arch (laminae and pedicles) is not available because of anatomic abnormalities. STUDY DESIGN: This is a case report. METHODS: An 18-year-old woman with progressive tetraparesis caused by increasing deformity of cervicothoracic spine underwent evaluation and surgical treatment: procedure and techniques were described. The clinical features, the radiological findings, and the outcomes were assessed. Complications and local recurrences were also recorded. RESULTS: Costotransverse joint screwing was successfully used in one case of severe cervicothoracic spine deformity with major hypoplasia of the pedicles. The posterior arch of one thoracic vertebra became mobile soon after periosteal stripping probably because of iatrogenic fracture of the only existent pedicle. The four-cortical trajectory of the screws resulted in a good bone purchase allowing the surgeon to complete the procedure. No local or general complications were recorded during 2 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure was used as a salvage technique during a difficult surgery where a local complication forced a change of strategy. Although the implant remained stable long enough to achieve fusion, it still consists of placing a screw through a joint that remains slightly mobile. This could possibly result in a screw loosening in the long period if fusion is not achieved. We suggest the use of this technique when all the other options have been explored and excluded for anatomical reasons.|Non-Cancer
ID:26011312|Title:Expression analysis of microRNA-125 in patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia and correlation with JAK2 allele burden and laboratory findings.Abstract:INTRODUCTION: The JAK2V617F mutation has emerged in recent years as a diagnostic as well as a treatment target in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The disease phenotype is also influenced by other factors such as microRNA (miRNA) deregulation. The aim of this study was to investigate miR-125 expression level in these patients with those obtained from healthy control subjects and its correlation with JAK2 allele burden and laboratory findings. METHODS: In total, forty patients with a clinical diagnosis of PV and ET were examined at the time of diagnosis. Ten healthy subjects were checked as controls. We performed JAK2 V617F allele burdens measurement and expression analysis of miR-125b-5p, miR-125b-3p, miR-125a-5p, and miR-125a-3p in leukocytes isolated from peripheral blood by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: MiR-125b-5p and miR-125a-5p were upregulated in both patients with PV (P = 0.00 and P = 0.003, respectively) and ET (P = 0.02 and P = 0.002, respectively). In PV group, a significant correlation was observed between miR-125a-5p and platelet counts (P = 0.01, r = 0.531). The correlation between miRNA and JAk2 allele burden was not significant. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our data indicate that other factors such as aberrant miR-125 expression may influence on the disease phenotype in patients with PV and ET.|Non-Cancer
ID:26020630|Title:Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoT Induces Atypical Anoikis Apoptosis in Target Host Cells by Transforming Crk Adaptor Protein into a Cytotoxin.Abstract:Previously, we demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoT induces potent apoptosis in host epithelial cells in a manner that primarily depends on its ADP-ribosyltransferase domain (ADPRT) activity. However, the mechanism underlying ExoT/ADPRT-induced apoptosis remains undetermined. We now report that ExoT/ADPRT disrupts focal adhesion sites, activates p38beta and JNK, and interferes with integrin-mediated survival signaling; causing atypical anoikis. We show that ExoT/ADPRT-induced anoikis is mediated by the Crk adaptor protein. We found that Crk-/- knockout cells are significantly more resistant to ExoT-induced apoptosis, while Crk-/- cells complemented with Crk are rendered sensitive to ExoT-induced apoptosis. Moreover, a dominant negative (DN) mutant form of Crk phenocopies ExoT-induced apoptosis both kinetically and mechanistically. Crk is generally believed to be a component of focal adhesion (FA) and its role in cellular survival remains controversial in that it has been found to be either pro-survival or pro-apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that although Crk is recruited to FA sites, its function is likely not required for FA assembly or for survival per se. However, when modified by ExoT or by mutagenesis, it can be transformed into a cytotoxin that induces anoikis by disrupting FA sites and interfering with integrin survival signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first example whereby a bacterial toxin exerts its cytotoxicity by subverting the function of an innocuous host cellular protein and turning it against the host cell.|Non-Cancer
ID:26022167|Title:Tuberous sclerosis complex.Abstract:Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal-dominant, neurocutaneous, multisystem disorder characterized by cellular hyperplasia and tissue dysplasia. The genetic cause is mutations in the TSC1 gene, found on chromosome 9q34, and TSC2 gene, found on chromosome 16p13. The clinical phenotypes resulting from mutations in either of the 2 genes are variable in each individual. Herein, advances in the understanding of molecular mechanisms in tuberous sclerosis complex are reviewed, and current guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and management are summarized.|Non-Cancer
ID:26059211|Title:Anetoderma in a patient with terminal osseous dysplasia with pigmentary defects.Abstract:Terminal osseous dysplasia with pigmentary defects (TODPD) is a rare, X-linked syndrome classically characterized by distal limb anomalies, pigmented skin defects of the face, and recurrent digital fibromas. X-inactivation plays a major role in determining the range of phenotypic expression. Thus, patients can demonstrate a wide spectrum of disease severity, making accurate diagnosis more challenging. Recent studies have identified a FLNA c.5217G>A mutation as the cause of TODPD, allowing for diagnostic genetic testing. We present a case of molecularly confirmed TODPD in a girl with the 47,XXX chromosomal complement and deformities of the hands and feet, craniofacial abnormalities, and discolored, linear facial lesions. Skin biopsy of the patient's facial lesion revealed absent papillary dermal elastic fibers, consistent with anetoderma, which contrasts with the dermal hypoplasia described in the only other such facial biopsy reported in the literature. The finding of absent elastic fibers in the skin lesions suggests that mutated filamin A, in part, exerts its effects through dysregulated elastin biology, which may explain the nature of many connective tissue pleotropic effects in FLNA-related disorders.|Non-Cancer
ID:26067933|Title:Detection of the KIT D816V mutation in peripheral blood of systemic mastocytosis: diagnostic implications.Abstract:Recent studies have found the KIT D816V mutation in peripheral blood of virtually all adult systemic mastocytosis patients once highly sensitive PCR techniques were used; thus, detection of the KIT D816V mutation in peripheral blood has been proposed to be included in the diagnostic work-up of systemic mastocytosis algorithms. However, the precise frequency of the mutation, the biological significance of peripheral blood-mutated cells and their potential association with involvement of bone marrow hematopoietic cells other than mast cells still remain to be investigated. Here, we determined the frequency of peripheral blood involvement by the KIT D816V mutation, as assessed by two highly sensitive PCR methods, and investigated its relationship with multilineage involvement of bone marrow hematopoiesis. Overall, our results confirmed the presence of the KIT D816V mutation in peripheral blood of most systemic mastocytosis cases (161/190; 85%)--with an increasing frequency from indolent systemic mastocytosis without skin lesions (29/44; 66%) to indolent systemic mastocytosis with skin involvement (124/135; 92%), and more aggressive disease subtypes (11/11; 100%)--as assessed by the allele-specific oligonucleotide-qPCR method, which was more sensitive (P<.0001) than the peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR approach (84/190; 44%). Although the presence of the KIT mutation in peripheral blood, as assessed by the allele-specific oligonucleotide-qPCR technique, did not accurately predict for multilineage bone marrow involvement of hematopoiesis, the allele-specific oligonucleotide-qPCR allele burden and the peptide nucleic acid-mediated-PCR approach did. These results suggest that both methods provide clinically useful and complementary information through the identification and/or quantification of the KIT D816V mutation in peripheral blood of patients suspected of systemic mastocytosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:26095439|Title:Urinary 11beta-PGF2alpha and N-methyl histamine correlate with bone marrow biopsy findings in mast cell disorders.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The utility of measuring histamine and prostaglandin metabolites in the urine of patients with mastocytosis has not been critically examined in a large series of patients. This study examined the relationship between the extent of increase in urinary excretion of 11beta-prostaglandinF2alpha and N-methyl histamine, with serum tryptase, whole blood serotonin, and bone marrow findings including morphology, percentage involvement, and abnormal mast cell phenotype. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 90 patients who were continuously enrolled in the study for a period of 6 years (2008-2014). We recorded serum tryptase, whole blood serotonin, levels of urinary mast cell metabolites 11beta-prostaglandinF2alpha and N-methyl histamine (NMH), and bone marrow findings. RESULTS: Urinary mast cell metabolites 11beta-prostaglandinF2alpha and N-methyl histamine correlated with levels of serum tryptase, mast cell burden in the bone marrow, the presence of mast cell aggregates, and atypical mast cells on bone marrow biopsy. Whole blood serotonin did not have a significant correlation with the serum tryptase or mast cell burden in the bone marrow. Urinary NMH was significantly different between c-kit D816V-positive and c-kit D816V-negative patients, while 11beta-prostaglandinF2alpha was not. Urinary 11beta-prostaglandinF2alpha 24-h excretion >3500 ng and NMH levels >400 mug/gm Cr corresponded with the high degree of bone marrow biopsies positive for atypical mast cells, the presence of aggregates, and c-kit mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Easily obtained and quantified urinary metabolites of histamine (greater than twice the upper limit of normal) and prostaglandin D2 (>3.4 times the upper limit of normal) correlate well with bone marrow findings of mastocytosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:26099230|Title:Vertical extraventricular functional hemispherotomy: a new variant for hemispheric disconnection. Technical notes and results in three patients.Abstract:PURPOSE: Hemispherectomy and disconnective hemispherotomy are the most effective epilepsy surgical procedures for the treatment of epilepsy due to hemispheric pathologies such as Sturge-Weber syndrome, diffuse hemispheric cortical dysplasia, and posttraumatic and postischemic focal lesions. Disconnective hemispherotomy is nowadays preferred to reduce surgical morbidity in term of early and late complications (i.e., cerebral superficial hemosiderosis). Despite the number of existing technical variants conceived to further reduce the amount of brain tissue to be removed, postoperative hydrocephalus still persists and may account for an average incidence of 15-41% according to different series and reviews. A new variant of disconnective vertical hemispherotomy we termed vertical extraventricular parasagittal hemispherotomy is described aiming to further reduce the amount of removed brain tissue and so the risk of postoperative hydrocephalus in favor of a pure hemispheric disconnection. METHODS: Three patients affected by drug-resistant epilepsy due to different hemispheric pathologies (posttraumatic epilepsy, Sturge-Weber syndrome, diffuse hemispheric cortical dysplasia) were considered to be candidates for vertical extraventricular parasagittal hemispherotomy disconnective based on presurgical evaluation protocol. The oldest patient was 15 years old, the two youngest were both 2 years old. RESULTS: None of the patients experienced early and late surgical complications. After a mean follow-up of 36 months (range 12-60 months), two patients were seizure free, one relapsed seizures 18 months later. Postoperative hydrocephalus never occurred. CONCLUSION: Vertical extraventricular parasagittal hemispherotomy may be an efficacious and less invasive technique as it consists in a pure disconnection of the hemisphere with less amount of brain tissue removed and a theoretical reduced risk of postoperative hydrocephalus.|Non-Cancer
ID:26134128|Title:Herpesvirus Genome Recognition Induced Acetylation of Nuclear IFI16 Is Essential for Its Cytoplasmic Translocation, Inflammasome and IFN-beta Responses.Abstract:The IL-1beta and type I interferon-beta (IFN-beta) molecules are important inflammatory cytokines elicited by the eukaryotic host as innate immune responses against invading pathogens and danger signals. Recently, a predominantly nuclear gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) involved in transcriptional regulation has emerged as an innate DNA sensor which induced IL-1beta and IFN-beta production through inflammasome and STING activation, respectively. Herpesvirus (KSHV, EBV, and HSV-1) episomal dsDNA genome recognition by IFI16 leads to IFI16-ASC-procaspase-1 inflammasome association, cytoplasmic translocation and IL-1beta production. Independent of ASC, HSV-1 genome recognition results in IFI16 interaction with STING in the cytoplasm to induce interferon-beta production. However, the mechanisms of IFI16-inflammasome formation, cytoplasmic redistribution and STING activation are not known. Our studies here demonstrate that recognition of herpesvirus genomes in the nucleus by IFI16 leads into its interaction with histone acetyltransferase p300 and IFI16 acetylation resulting in IFI16-ASC interaction, inflammasome assembly, increased interaction with Ran-GTPase, cytoplasmic redistribution, caspase-1 activation, IL-1beta production, and interaction with STING which results in IRF-3 phosphorylation, nuclear pIRF-3 localization and interferon-beta production. ASC and STING knockdowns did not affect IFI16 acetylation indicating that this modification is upstream of inflammasome-assembly and STING-activation. Vaccinia virus replicating in the cytoplasm did not induce nuclear IFI16 acetylation and cytoplasmic translocation. IFI16 physically associates with KSHV and HSV-1 genomes as revealed by proximity ligation microscopy and chromatin-immunoprecipitation studies which is not hampered by the inhibition of acetylation, thus suggesting that acetylation of IFI16 is not required for its innate sensing of nuclear viral genomes. Collectively, these studies identify the increased nuclear acetylation of IFI16 as a dynamic essential post-genome recognition event in the nucleus that is common to the IFI16-mediated innate responses of inflammasome induction and IFN-beta production during herpesvirus (KSHV, EBV, HSV-1) infections.|Non-Cancer
ID:26149588|Title:Hymenoptera Anaphylaxis and C-kit Mutations: An Unexpected Association.Abstract:Clinical manifestations of mastocytosis in adults comprise signs and symptoms linked to mast cell (MC) activation, including anaphylaxis. Depending on MC burden, adults can be diagnosed with systemic mastocytosis, when the WHO criteria are fulfilled, or with other clonal MC disorders, characterized by MC mediator symptoms and demonstration of activating KIT mutations and/or expression of CD25 on MCs. There is a specific link between mastocytosis and hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA): the reported frequency of HVA in mastocytosis is 20-50 % and raises to 60-80 % in patients affected by indolent systemic mastocytosis without skin lesions. The presentation of HVA characterized by severe hypotension in the absence of urticarial or angioedema is typical in patient with an underlying MC disorder, even in the presence of normal baseline serum tryptase levels.|Non-Cancer
ID:26152315|Title:Large maculopapular cutaneous lesions are associated with favorable outcome in childhood-onset mastocytosis.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis, characterized by pathologic accumulation of mast cells, can manifest itself in adulthood or childhood. Pediatric patients usually have cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) with mast cell infiltrates limited to the skin and spontaneous improvement of skin lesions after several years. However, there are some patients with persistent disease resembling adulthood-onset mastocytosis. OBJECTIVE: The current classification of CM differentiates between 3 subforms. In clinical practice we noticed that different variants of these subforms might exist, particularly in patients with childhood-onset mastocytosis. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to investigate whether specific cutaneous lesions in patients with childhood-onset mastocytosis are associated with other disease parameters. METHODS: We analyzed 144 patients with a disease onset of less than age 17 years using a systematic dermatologic approach. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two patients presented with maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM), 12 patients presented with diffuse CM, and 10 patients presented with solitary mastocytoma of the skin. Patients with MPCM showed particularly heterogeneous cutaneous lesions and were therefore grouped into 3 variants presenting either with small lesions (MPCM-small, skin lesions <1 cm in diameter; n = 19), large lesions (MPCM-large, skin lesions >= 1 cm in diameter; n = 89), or atypical lesions (MPCM-other, n = 14). Patients with MPCM-large lesions, compared with those with MPCM-small lesions, were characterized by significantly lower tryptase levels, shorter disease duration, and earlier disease onset. In addition, more patients with MPCM-large lesions exhibited spontaneous regression of cutaneous lesions. CONCLUSION: Our data show that patients with MPCM-large lesions compared with those with MPCM-small lesions have a more favorable disease course and suggest exploring the size of cutaneous lesions as a prognostic parameter in childhood-onset MPCM.|Non-Cancer
ID:26153655|Title:Increased IL6 plasma levels in indolent systemic mastocytosis patients are associated with high risk of disease progression.Abstract:Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a heterogeneous disease with altered interleukin (IL)-6 and IL13 plasma levels. However, no study has simultaneously investigated the plasma levels of IL1beta, IL6, IL13, CCL23 and clusterin in SM at diagnosis and correlated them with disease outcome. Here we investigated IL1beta, IL6, IL13, CCL23 and clusterin plasma levels in 75 SM patients--66 indolent SM (ISM) and 9 aggressive SM--and analyzed their prognostic impact among ISM cases grouped according to the extent of hematopoietic involvement of the bone marrow cells by the KIT D816V mutation. Although increased IL1beta, IL6 and CCL23 levels were detected in SM patients versus healthy controls, only IL6 and CCL23 levels gradually increased with disease severity. Moreover, increased IL6 plasma levels were associated with ISM progression to more aggressive disease, in particular among ISM patients with multilineal KIT mutation (ISM-ML), these patients also showing a higher frequency of organomegalies, versus other ISM-ML patients. Of note, all ISM patients who progressed had increased IL6 plasma levels already at diagnosis. Our results indicate that SM patients display an altered plasma cytokine profile already at diagnosis, increased IL6 plasma levels emerging as an early marker for disease progression among ISM cases, in particular among high-risk ISM patients who carry multilineage KIT mutation.|Non-Cancer
ID:26159157|Title:Massive gastric polyposis associated with a germline SMAD4 gene mutation.Abstract:Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract. Polyps are most common in the colorectum (98% of patients) and the stomach (14%). Causative mutations for JPS have been identified in two genes to date, SMAD4 and BMPR1A. SMAD4 mutations are associated with a higher incidence of gastric polyposis. In this case report, we describe two patients with massive gastric polyposis associated with a SMAD4 mutation. Both presented with anaemia and both had colonic polyps. Initial endoscopic findings revealed giant rugal folds suggestive of Menetrier disease. However, as other possible gastropathies could not be differentiated on the basis of histology, a definitive diagnosis of JPS required additional mutation analysis. In patients with polyposis predominant in or limited to the stomach, establishing a diagnosis based solely on the pathological features of polyps can be challenging due to difficulties in differentiating JPS from other hypertrophic gastropathies. Mutation analysis should be considered early in the diagnostic process in cases of suspected juvenile polyposis, thus facilitating rapid diagnosis and adequate follow-up.|Non-Cancer
ID:26221972|Title:A polymorphism in a phosphotyrosine signalling motif of CD229 (Ly9, SLAMF3) alters SH2 domain binding and T-cell activation.Abstract:Signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family members regulate activation and inhibition in the innate and adaptive immune systems. Genome-wide association studies identified their genetic locus (1q23) as highly polymorphic and associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here we show that the Val602 variant of the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs509749 in the SLAM family member CD229 (Ly9, SLAMF3) has a two-fold lower affinity compared with the SLE-associated Met602 variant for the small adaptor protein SAP. Comparison of the two variants in T-cell lines revealed the Val602 variant to be significantly more highly expressed than CD229 Met602 . Activation was diminished in cells expressing CD229 Val602 compared with CD229 Met602 as measured by up-regulation of CD69. There was no correlation between homozygosity at rs509749 and activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. These findings identify potential mechanisms by which a single SNP can perturb fine-tuning in the immune system with significant functional consequences.|Non-Cancer
ID:26230867|Title:Pathologic Findings in NEMO Deficiency: A Surgical and Autopsy Survey.Abstract:Hypomorphic mutations in nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) essential modulator (NEMO), encoded by IKBKG, lead to a variable combined immunodeficiency, which puts patients at risk of early death from infectious complications. The spectrum of clinical manifestations includes inflammatory disorders, especially colitis. Because of the multiple complications of NEMO deficiency, a variety of biopsy, excisional, and autopsy materials from these patients may be subject to pathologic examination. Therefore, using samples from a cohort of patients with this disorder, we aimed to survey the pathologic spectrum of NEMO deficiency and search for correlations between specific genotypes and phenotypes. Clinical and laboratory data, mutation analysis, and pathology from 13 patients were examined, including 6 autopsies. No specific genotype-pathology correlation was identified. However, we confirmed an association between ectodermal dysplasia and inflammatory conditions. We found no characteristic pathology to identify patients with NEMO deficiency; therefore, history, physical examination, and specific infections must remain the clues to suggest the diagnosis. Variability among patients and by infection makes the pathologic recognition of NEMO deficiency challenging.|Non-Cancer
ID:26276780|Title:Morphologically occult systemic mastocytosis in bone marrow: clinicopathologic features and an algorithmic approach to diagnosis.Abstract:OBJECTIVES: Bone marrow (BM) biopsy specimens involved by systemic mastocytosis (SM) typically show multifocal, compact, dense aggregates of spindled mast cells (MCs). However, some cases lack aggregate formation and fulfill the World Health Organization 2008 criteria for SM, based on minor criteria. METHODS: We identified 26 BM cases of KIT D816V-mutated, morphologically occult SM in the BM. RESULTS: All patients had some combination of allergic/MC activating symptoms. Peripheral blood counts were generally normal. BM aspirates showed 5% or less MCs, which were only occasionally spindled. BM biopsy specimens showed no morphologic classic MC lesions. Tryptase immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrated interstitial, individually distributed MCs (up to 5%) with prominent spindling, lacking aggregate formation. MCs coexpressed CD25 by IHC and/or flow cytometry. Spindled MCs constituted more than 25% of total MCs in all cases and more than 50% in 20 of 26 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Morphologically occult involvement of normal-appearing BM by SM will be missed without appropriate clinical suspicion and pathologic evaluation by tryptase and CD25 IHC and KIT D816V mutation analysis. On the basis of these findings, we propose a cost-effective, data-driven, evidence-based algorithmic approach to the workup of these cases.|Non-Cancer
ID:26291959|Title:Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for CD40 Ligand Deficiency: Single Institution Experience.Abstract:BACKGROUND: X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (X-HIGM) due to mutations in the gene encoding CD40 ligand results in failure of Ig class switching and an increased propensity for recurrent sinopulmonary and other infections, and thus decreased life expectancy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative, but long-term follow-up data are limited. PROCEDURES: We conducted a retrospective analysis of seven patients who have undergone allogeneic HSCT for HIGM syndrome at Duke University Medical Center. RESULTS: Median age at transplant was 5.2 years (range 0.7-19.3). None of the patients had active hepatic or pulmonary disease immediately prior to transplant, but all had a history of serious infections. Five patients received myeloablative conditioning, and two patients received reduced intensity conditioning. Graft sources included bone marrow, peripheral blood, and unrelated umbilical cord blood. Post-transplantation complications included veno-occlusive disease, hemorrhagic cystitis, adenoviremia, and cryptosporidium recurrence in one patient each. Two patients developed acute GVHD grades II-IV that resolved promptly with treatment and none developed extensive chronic GVHD. All patients are intravenous IgG-independent and 6/7 have normal antibody titers. Immunoglobulin (Ig) A levels normalized in all but one patient and T and B cell numbers and function are otherwise normal in all. All patients are alive at a median follow-up of 9.7 (range 9.7-16.1) years post-transplantation with predominantly donor chimerism and no recurrent infections. CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic HSCT results in excellent survival and sustained immune reconstitution in patients with CD40 ligand deficiency using both myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning approaches and various graft sources, including bone marrow, peripheral blood, and umbilical cord blood.|Non-Cancer
ID:26369259|Title:An Adverse Implication of Radiation Therapy for Implant-Retained Maxillofacial Prostheses.Abstract:We report the 19-year postoperative course of a patient whose maxillary defect was reconstructed with maxillofacial implant-retained facial prostheses. The patient received 60 Gy of radiation therapy. Adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy was administered and four 4.0-mm long maxillofacial implants were inserted. Four years and 6 months after insertion surgery, two of the four implants were lost and the others showed bone regression in the surrounding bone. All implants were replaced with Epitec System maxillofacial implants placed in non-irradiated bone. Eleven years and 6 months after replacement, the Epitec System has been maintaining good and firm osseointegration. Appropriate selection of implant sites and no history of radiation therapy are keys to successful implant reconstruction. However, adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy is believed to be effective, osseointegrated implant should be inserted at a point appropriately distant from an irradiated lesion.|Non-Cancer
ID:26400824|Title:Effect of a thrombopoietin receptor agonist on use of intravenous immune globulin in patients with immune thrombocytopenia.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Thrombopoietin receptor agonists are new treatments for patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). How one of these agent, romiplostim, has impacted practice patterns, especially the use of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), has not been evaluated outside of clinical trials. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult ITP patients treated with romiplostim in four Canadian centers. Patients had primary or secondary ITP and were followed for 1 year before starting weekly romiplostim treatment. We compared IVIG use, clinical outcomes, and cost before and after romiplostim. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with ITP received romiplostim. Median age was 54 years (interquartile range [IQR], 45-63 years) and patients had a median of two prior ITP treatments (IQR, 1-4) including splenectomy (n = 7). Median platelet (PLT) count was 23 x 10(9) before and 124 x 10(9) after romiplostim. Median duration of romiplostim treatment was 3.7 months. Patients used a median of two IVIG infusions per year before and 0.7 per year after starting romiplostim (p = 0.16). For patients who received weekly romiplostim for at least 1 month (n = 19), IVIG infusions were three (IQR, 1-5) per year before and 0.7 (IQR, 0.4-1.6) per year after romiplostim. Results were squewed by two high IVIG users. Nineteen (66%) patients discontinued romiplostim treatment during follow-up because of lack of response (n = 8), sustained response (n = 5), toxicities (n = 4), or response to splenectomy (n = 2). Overall health care costs were similar before and after romiplostim when concomitant treatments, nursing resources, and hospitalizations were considered. CONCLUSIONS: Romiplostim was associated with improved PLT counts and fewer IVIG infusions for most ITP patients. In practice, romiplostim was generally not continued long term and was cost neutral for overall ITP management.|Non-Cancer
ID:26430803|Title:Modeling Linkage Disequilibrium Increases Accuracy of Polygenic Risk Scores.Abstract:Polygenic risk scores have shown great promise in predicting complex disease risk and will become more accurate as training sample sizes increase. The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning and applying a p value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and can reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred, a method that infers the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the approach of pruning followed by thresholding, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, predicted R(2) increased from 20.1% to 25.3% in a large schizophrenia dataset and from 9.8% to 12.0% in a large multiple sclerosis dataset. A similar relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three additional large disease datasets and for non-European schizophrenia samples. The advantage of LDpred over existing methods will grow as sample sizes increase.|Non-Cancer
ID:26432562|Title:A Case of Recurrent Ischemic Stroke Involving Subacute, Progressive Intracranial Cerebral Arterial Sclerosis Prior to Diagnosis with JAK2-mutated Polycythemia Vera.Abstract:CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old man presenting with no vascular risk factors visited our hospital with right hemiparesis and total aphasia. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple hyperintensities in watershed distributions in the left hemisphere. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed stenosis of the middle cerebral artery, despite normal MRA findings 2 months prior. One year after the first stroke, the patient experienced a recurrent ischemic stroke involving the left anterior choroidal artery, pulmonary embolism, and deep venous thrombosis. After the recurrent stroke event, hemoglobin levels increased gradually. Two years after the first stroke, a JAK2V-617F mutation was detected. CONCLUSION: Our report suggests that progressive intracranial arterial sclerosis and venous thrombosis of undetermined etiologies could be several initial symptoms of polycythemia vera.|Non-Cancer
ID:26456532|Title:Diagnosis and classification of mastocytosis in non-specialized versus reference centres: a Spanish Network on Mastocytosis (REMA) study on 122 patients.Abstract:The diagnosis of 'rare diseases', such as mastocytosis, remains a challenge. Despite this, the precise benefits of referral of mastocytosis patients to highly specialized reference centres are poorly defined and whether patients should be managed at non-specialized versus reference centres remains a matter of debate. To evaluate the quality and efficiency of diagnostic procedures performed at the reference centres for mastocytosis in Spain (REMA) versus other non-reference centres, we retrospectively analysed a series of 122 patients, for the overall degree of agreement obtained for the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic and classification criteria betwen the referring and REMA centres. Our results showed that not all WHO diagnostic criteria were frequently investigated at the referring centres. Among the five WHO diagnostic criteria, the highest degree of agreement was obtained for serum tryptase levels [median 90% (95% confidence interval 84-96%)]; in turn, the overall agreement was significantly lower for the major histopathological criterion [80% (72-89%)], and the other three minor criteria: cytomorphology [68% (56-80%)] immunophenotyping of BM mast cells [75% (62-87%)] and detection of the KIT mutation [34% (8-60%)]. Referral of patients with diagnostic suspicion of mastocytosis to a multidisciplinary reference centre improves diagnostic efficiency and quality.|Non-Cancer
ID:26456649|Title:Generation and periodontal differentiation of human gingival fibroblasts-derived integration-free induced pluripotent stem cells.Abstract:Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been recognized as a promising cell source for periodontal tissue regeneration. However, the conventional virus-based reprogramming approach is associated with a high risk of genetic mutation and limits their therapeutic utility. Here, we successfully generated iPSCs from readily accessible human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) through an integration-free and feeder-free approach via delivery of reprogramming factors of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, L-myc, Lin28 and TP53 shRNA with episomal plasmid vectors. The iPSCs presented similar morphology and proliferation characteristics as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and expressed pluripotent markers including Oct4, Tra181, Nanog and SSEA-4. Additionally, these cells maintained a normal karyotype and showed decreased CpG methylation ratio in the promoter regions of Oct4 and Nanog. In vivo teratoma formation assay revealed the development of tissues representative of three germ layers, confirming the acquisition of pluripotency. Furthermore, treatment of the iPSCs in vitro with enamel matrix derivative (EMD) or growth/differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5) significantly up-regulated the expression of periodontal tissue markers associated with bone, periodontal ligament and cementum respectively. Taken together, our data demonstrate that hGFs are a valuable cell source for generating integration-free iPSCs, which could be sequentially induced toward periodontal cells under the treatment of EMD and GDF-5.|Non-Cancer
ID:26460258|Title:An unusual long-term outcome of a child with primary myelofibrosis harboring a JAK2 mutation.Abstract:We report an extremely rare case of a female child who presented the onset of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) harboring JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2 gene) mutation (JAK2V617F) when she was 15 months old. She was monitored over 25 years, a period in which she was treated with spleen radiotherapy and recombinant interferon alpha. She also underwent splenectomy when she was 13 years old, due to massive splenomegaly, anemia and various infection disease episodes. The longstanding evolution of the patient enabled us to verify that there were no complications related to post-splenectomy events and/or blast transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe PMF with JAK2 mutation in a child. We provide evidence that a better quality of life and long survival in pediatric PMF may be provided by splenectomy.|Non-Cancer
ID:26468051|Title:The common gamma-chain cytokine receptor: tricks-and-treats for T cells.Abstract:Originally identified as the third subunit of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor complex, the common gamma-chain (gammac) also acts as a non-redundant receptor subunit for a series of other cytokines, collectively known as gammac family cytokines. gammac plays essential roles in T cell development and differentiation, so that understanding the molecular basis of its signaling and regulation is a critical issue in T cell immunology. Unlike most other cytokine receptors, gammac is thought to be constitutively expressed and limited in its function to the assembly of high-affinity cytokine receptors. Surprisingly, recent studies reported a series of findings that unseat gammac as a simple housekeeping gene, and unveiled gammac as a new regulatory molecule in T cell activation and differentiation. Cytokine-independent binding of gammac to other cytokine receptor subunits suggested a pre-association model of gammac with proprietary cytokine receptors. Also, identification of a gammac splice isoform revealed expression of soluble gammac proteins (sgammac). sgammac directly interacted with surface IL-2Rbeta to suppress IL-2 signaling and to promote pro-inflammatory Th17 cell differentiation. As a result, endogenously produced sgammac exacerbated autoimmune inflammatory disease, while the removal of endogenous sgammac significantly ameliorated disease outcome. These data provide new insights into the role of both membrane and soluble gammac in cytokine signaling, and open new venues to interfere and modulate gammac signaling during immune activation. These unexpected discoveries further underscore the perspective that gammac biology remains largely uncharted territory that invites further exploration.|Non-Cancer
ID:26471738|Title:Evaluation of romiplostim for the treatment of secondary failure of platelet recovery among allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.Abstract:Secondary failure of platelet recovery (SFPR) is a serious complication observed in approximately 20% of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Although the standard therapeutic approach has been frequent platelet transfusions, romiplostim, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, may have utility in treating SFPR. The primary objective of this single-center retrospective analysis was to assess effectiveness of romiplostim for SFPR and to evaluate patient factors which may influence clinical outcomes. The primary outcome measure of response was defined as achievement of platelet count >= 50 x 109/L without transfusions for >= 7 consecutive days. During the study period, 93 patients underwent HSCT and 13 (13.9%) received romiplostim for SFPR. Seven patients (53.8%) responded to romiplostim, requiring a median of three doses (range 1-6) to achieve independence from platelet transfusions. Disease relapse occurred in 38.5% of all patients, two responders and three nonresponders. Median survival post-HSCT was 753 days among responders and 266 days among nonresponders ( p = 0.0375). No serious adverse events were reported, and rates of graft-versus-host disease did not increase following administration of romiplostim. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists including romiplostim offer a treatment option for persistent thrombocytopenia following HSCT. Positive clinical response to romiplostim post-HSCT is associated with improved outcomes.|Non-Cancer
ID:26485416|Title:Cerebellar Enterogenous Cyst with Atypical Appearance and Pathological Findings.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Intracranial enterogenous cysts are rare and occur mainly in the posterior fossa. These cysts are usually extra-axial, midline, anterior to the brainstem, or at the cerebellopontine angle. Intracranial intra-axial enterogenous cysts are extremely rare. We report a case of an intra-axial cerebellar enterogenous cyst in which diagnosis was difficult because the lesion resembled an arachnoid cyst in appearance and showed atypical pathologic findings. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old woman had a 2-year history of progressive headache, giddiness, and unsteadiness of gait. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic lesion with isointensity to cerebrospinal fluid in the left cerebellar hemisphere, reaching into the fourth ventricle. The patient underwent fenestration of the cyst and creation of a communication between the fourth ventricle and cyst because the tight attachment of the cyst wall to the cerebellum prevented total removal of the cyst. Although pathologic examinations did not show findings typical of enterogenous cyst, the diagnosis was finally made based on the presence of basement membrane and immunohistochemical results. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of enterogenous cyst is based mainly on histologic findings, because characteristic findings on neuroimaging have not been defined. Although total resection of enterogenous cysts is recommended in general, partial resection while ensuring the cyst communicates adequately with the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid space with or without a shunt procedure may be useful if the cyst is adherent to surrounding neurovascular structures.|Non-Cancer
ID:26511139|Title:Correlation between mutations and mRNA expression of APC and MUTYH genes: new insight into hereditary colorectal polyposis predisposition.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Transcript dosage imbalance may influence the transcriptome. To gain insight into the role of altered gene expression in hereditary colorectal polyposis predisposition, in the present study we analyzed absolute and allele-specific expression (ASE) of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and mutY Homolog (MUTYH) genes. METHODS: We analyzed DNA and RNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 49 familial polyposis patients and 42 healthy blood donors selected according similar gender and age. Patients were studied for germline alterations in both genes using dHPLC, MLPA and automated sequencing. APC and MUTYH mRNA expression levels were investigated by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis using TaqMan assay and by ASE assays using dHPLC-based primer extension. RESULTS: Twenty out of 49 patients showed germline mutations: 14 in APC gene and six in MUTYH gene. Twenty-nine patients did not show mutations in both genes. Results from qRT-PCR indicated that gene expression of both APC and MUTYH was reduced in patients analyzed. In particular, a significant reduction in APC expression was observed in patients without APC germline mutation vs control group (P < 0.05) while APC expression in the mutation carrier patients, although lower compared to control individuals, did not show statistical significance. On the other hand a significant reduced MUTYH expression was detected in patients with MUTYH mutations vs control group (P < 0.05). Altered ASE of APC was detected in four out of eight APC mutation carriers. In particular one case showed a complete loss of one allele. Among APC mutation negative cases, 4 out of 13 showed a moderate ASE. ASE of MUTYH did not show any altered expression in the cases analyzed. Spearman's Rho Test analysis showed a positive and significant correlation between APC and MUTYH genes both in cases and in controls (P = 0.020 and P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: APC and MUTYH showed a reduced germline expression, not always corresponding to gene mutation. Expression of APC is decreased in mutation negative cases and this appears to be a promising indicator of FAP predisposition, while for MUTYH gene, mutation is associated to reduced mRNA expression. This study could improve the predictive genetic diagnosis of at-risk individuals belonging to families with reduced mRNA expression regardless of presence of mutation.|Non-Cancer
ID:26513044|Title:Nevus anemicus associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 in a neonate: a case report.Abstract:Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multisystemic autosomal dominant disease affecting approximately 1 individual in 3500. The diagnostic criteria developed by NIH in 1988 allow unequivocal diagnosis in all cases but the youngest children. Due to the variable phenotypic expression, the diagnosis of NF1 in the youngest may be challenging, particularly when the distinctive cutaneous lesions are missing. We describe the case of a neonate who presented at birth solely with a nevus anemicus. Although this is not considered a diagnostic feature, given the presence of a few cafe au lait lesions in the patient's father, the genetic test was performed and the diagnosis of NF1 confirmed. To our knowledge, the association between nevus anemicus and NF1 is only anedoctal. The peculiarity clinical manifestation of this case highlights the high variable expressivity of the NF1 gene mutation and reinforces the importance of genetic counseling in affected individuals.|Non-Cancer
ID:26524254|Title:Altered cerebellum development and impaired motor coordination in mice lacking the Btg1 gene: Involvement of cyclin D1.Abstract:Cerebellar granule neurons develop postnatally from cerebellar granule precursors (GCPs), which are located in the external granule layer (EGL) where they massively proliferate. Thereafter, GCPs become postmitotic, migrate inward to form the internal granule layer (IGL), further differentiate and form synapses with Purkinje cell dendrites. We previously showed that the Btg family gene, Tis21/Btg2, is required for normal GCP migration. Here we investigated the role in cerebellar development of the related gene, Btg1, which regulates stem cell quiescence in adult neurogenic niches, and is expressed in the cerebellum. Knockout of Btg1 in mice caused a major increase of the proliferation of the GCPs in the EGL, whose thickness increased, remaining hyperplastic even after postnatal day 14, when the EGL is normally reduced to a few GCP layers. This was accompanied by a slight decrease of differentiation and migration of the GCPs and increase of apoptosis. The GCPs of double Btg1/Tis21-null mice presented combined major defects of proliferation and migration outside the EGL, indicating that each gene plays unique and crucial roles in cerebellar development. Remarkably, these developmental defects lead to a permanent increase of the adult cerebellar volume in Btg1-null and double mutant mice, and to impairment in all mutants, including Tis21-null, of the cerebellum-dependent motor coordination. Gain- and loss-of-function strategies in a GCP cell line revealed that Btg1 regulates the proliferation of GCPs selectively through cyclin D1. Thus, Btg1 plays a critical role for cerebellar maturation and function.|Non-Cancer
ID:26531733|Title:Neurofibromatosis 1-associated panhypopituitarism presenting as hypoglycaemic seizures and stroke-like symptoms.Abstract:A 37-year-old man with a known history of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) presented within 2 days of diarrhoeal illness followed by encephalopathy, facial twitching, hypoglycaemia, hypotension, tachycardia and low-grade fever. Examination showed multiple cafe-au-lait spots and neurofibromas over the trunk, arms and legs and receptive aphasia with right homonymous hemianopia, which resolved. Workup for cardiac, inflammatory and infectious aetiologies was unrevealing. A brain MRI showed gyral swelling with increased T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal and diffusion restriction in the left cerebral cortex. Neuroendocrine findings suggested panhypopituitarism with centrally derived adrenal insufficiency. Supportive treatment, hormone supplementation, antibiotics, antivirals and levetiracetam yielded clinical improvement. A follow-up brain MRI showed focal left parieto-occipital atrophy with findings of cortical laminar necrosis. In conclusion, we describe a case of NF1-associated panhypopituitarism presenting as hypoglycaemic seizures and stroke-like findings, hitherto unreported manifestations of NF1. Prompt recognition and treatment of these associated conditions can prevent devastating complications.|Non-Cancer
ID:26537623|Title:Remission and platelet responses with romiplostim in primary immune thrombocytopenia: final results from a phase 2 study.Abstract:In anecdotal reports, some patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) maintained platelet counts after discontinuing romiplostim. Here, we examined rates of platelet response (>=50 x 10(9) /l), remission, splenectomy and adverse events in patients with primary ITP duration <=6 months who were treated with romiplostim for <=12 months. The starting dose of romiplostim was 1 mug/kg; concomitant and rescue treatments were permitted to maintain platelet counts. Patients with platelet counts >=50 x 10(9) /l at the end of 12 months entered a dose taper in which the romiplostim dose was decreased as long as platelet counts were maintained. Remission (platelet count >=50 x 10(9) /l for 24 consecutive weeks with no ITP treatments) was evaluated in patients once romiplostim was discontinued. Over the 12 months, a high response rate (>90%) was observed. Platelet response occurred quickly (median, ~2 weeks) and was observed for a cumulative median of 11 months. Remission was observed in 24 patients (32%); there were no significantly predictors of remission. Most (20/24) patients had remission start before the forced taper. No new safety signals were identified. Thus, in patients with early-stage ITP, romiplostim was well tolerated and induced rapid responses, with remission occurring in approximately one-third of patients (NCT01143038, Amgen 20080435).|Non-Cancer
ID:26545049|Title:Microdeletion del(22)(q12.1) excluding the MN1 gene in a patient with craniofacial anomalies.Abstract:Several studies have recently reported that 22q12.1 deletions encompassing the MN1 gene are associated with craniofacial anomalies. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that MN1 haploinsufficiency may be solely responsible for craniofacial anomalies and/or cleft palate. We report here the case of a 4-year-old boy presenting with global developmental delay and craniofacial anomalies including severe maxillary protrusion and retromicrognathia. Array-CGH detected a 2.4 Mb de novo deletion of chromosome 22q12.1 which did not encompass the MN1 gene thought to be the main pathological candidate in 22q12.1 deletions. This observation, combined with data from other patients from the Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensemble Resources (DECIPHER), suggests that other gene(s) in the 22q12.1 region are likely involved in craniofacial anomalies and/or may contribute to the phenotypic variability observed in patients with MN1 deletion.|Non-Cancer
ID:26546030|Title:Update on Mastocytosis (Part 1): Pathophysiology, Clinical Features, and Diagnosis.Abstract:Mastocytosis is a term used to describe a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by clonal proliferation of mast cells in various organs. The organ most often affected is the skin. Mastocytosis is a relatively rare disorder that affects both sexes equally. It can occur at any age, although it tends to appear in the first decade of life, or later, between the second and fifth decades. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of mastocytosis has improved greatly in recent years, with the discovery that somatic c-kit mutations and aberrant immunophenotypic features have an important role. The clinical manifestations of mastocytosis are diverse, and skin lesions are the key to diagnosis in most patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:26556733|Title:Effects of zoledronic acid on bone fusion in osteoporotic patients after lumbar fusion.Abstract:UNLABELLED: Treatment with zoledronic acid in osteoporotic patients with spinal fusion shortens the duration of time to fusion, improves the fusion rate, prevents the subsequent adjacent vertebral compression fractures, improves the clinical outcomes, and prevents immobilization-induced bone loss in the hip. INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to explore the effects of zoledronic acid on the healing process in osteoporotic patients following spinal fusion in a randomized, placebo-controlled, and triple-blinded study. METHODS: Seventy-nine osteoporotic patients with single-level degenerative spondylolisthesis were randomly assigned to receive either zoledronic acid infusion (zoledronic acid group) or saline infusion (controls) after spinal fusion. Functional radiography and CT scans were used to evaluate fusion status. Bone formation was graded into three categories: Grade A (bridging bone bonding with adjacent vertebral bodies), Grade B (bridging bone bonding with either superior or inferior vertebral body), or Grade C (incomplete bony bridging). A solid fusion was defined as less than 5  of angular motion with Grade A or B bone formation. Adjacent vertebral compression fractures (VCF) were assessed on MRI at 12 months after surgery. Serum level of carboxy terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (beta-CTX) and amino-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) was measured. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by DXA. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used to assess the clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Grade A or B bridging bone was more frequently observed in zoledronic acid group at 3, 6, and 9 months post-operation compared to the control group (p < 0.05). At 12 -months post-operation, bridging bone and solid fusion were not significantly different between groups. No patients in zoledronic acid group showed aVCF, whereas six patients (17 %) in the control group did (p < 0.05). Both beta-CTX and PINP were suppressed in zoledronic acid group. BMD at the femoral neck decreased rapidly and did not return to the preoperative level in the controls at 3 (-1.4 %), 6 (-2.5 %), and 12 (-0.8 %) months after surgery. Zoledronic acid prevented this immobilization-induced bone loss and increased BMD. ODI showed the improved clinical outcomes compared with controls at 9 and 12 months post-surgery. CONCLUSION: Treatment with zoledronic acid in osteoporotic patients with spinal fusion shortens the time to fusion, improves the fusion rate, prevents subsequent aVCFs, and improves clinical outcomes.|Non-Cancer
ID:26584349|Title:Mesenchymal stem cells engineered to express selectin ligands and IL-10 exert enhanced therapeutic efficacy in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.Abstract:Systemic administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) affords the potential to ameliorate the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in both preclinical and clinical studies. However, the efficacy of MSC-based therapy for MS likely depends on the number of cells that home to inflamed tissues and on the controlled production of paracrine and immunomodulatory factors. Previously, we reported that engineered MSCs expressing P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and Sialyl-Lewis(x) (SLeX) via mRNA transfection facilitated the targeted delivery of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) to inflamed ear. Here, we evaluated whether targeted delivery of MSCs with triple PSGL1/SLeX/IL-10 engineering improves therapeutic outcomes in mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model for human MS. We found PSGL-1/SLeX mRNA transfection significantly enhanced MSC homing to the inflamed spinal cord. This is consistent with results from in vitro flow chamber assays in which PSGL-1/SleX mRNA transfection significantly increased the percentage of rolling and adherent cells on activated brain microvascular endothelial cells, which mimic the inflamed endothelium of blood brain/spinal cord barrier in EAE. In addition, IL-10-transfected MSCs show significant inhibitory activity on the proliferation of CD4(+) T lymphocytes from EAE mice. In vivo treatment with MSCs engineered with PSGL-1/SLeX/IL-10 in EAE mice exhibited a superior therapeutic function over native (unmodified) MSCs, evidenced by significantly improved myelination and decreased lymphocytes infiltration into the white matter of the spinal cord. Our strategy of targeted delivery of performance-enhanced MSCs could potentially be utilized to increase the effectiveness of MSC-based therapy for MS and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders.|Non-Cancer
ID:26584588|Title:The human decapping scavenger enzyme DcpS modulates microRNA turnover.Abstract:The decapping scavenger enzyme DcpS is known for its role in hydrolyzing the cap structure following mRNA degradation. Recently, we discovered a new function in miRNA degradation activation for the ortholog of DcpS in C. elegans. Here we show that human DcpS conserves its role in miRNA turnover. In human cells, DcpS is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that activates miRNA degradation independently of its scavenger decapping activity in the cytoplasmic compartment. We also demonstrate that this new function for DcpS requires the contribution of the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn2. Our findings support a conserved role of DcpS as a modulator of miRNA turnover in animals.|Non-Cancer
ID:26586230|Title:Diverse Cutaneous Presentations of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis in Children: A Retrospective Cohort Study.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease, frequently affecting young children. PROCEDURE: We performed a retrospective study in patients younger than 16 years old manifesting with skin symptoms, and documented their different cutaneous lesions and systemic symptoms. We compared subgroups of children with single-system, skin-only, and multisystem disease and sought signs predictive for multisystem disease. In a small sample of patients, BRAF mutations were analyzed in archived biopsies. RESULTS: A wide spectrum of cutaneous presentations varying from crusted nodules and papules, blisters, vascular tumor-like lesions, scaling orange to red macules (frequently in seborrheic regions) to purpuric macules, and papules was documented in our cohort of 32 children. Otitis externa was a common manifestation and mucosal lesions were seen in three patients. A novel manifestation was a red-blue nodule that appeared in a patient after a vaccination. None of the cutaneous lesions was predictive for the classification or final outcome as a single-system or multisystem disease. However, later onset and a more protracted course of skin lesions were more frequent findings in multisystem LCH. Mucosal lesions and otitis externa were almost exclusively seen in patients with multisystem disease, a finding that warrants further investigation. Both wild-type (WT) and mutated BRAF were found not only in multisystem LCH, but also in skin-only LCH. Two cases with rapidly resolving congenital lesions had WT BRAF. CONCLUSIONS: Late onset and a protracted course of skin lesions are associated with MS-LCH, whereas WT BRAF is found in rapidly resolving skin lesions.|Non-Cancer
ID:26622064|Title:KIT D816V-mutated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in indolent systemic mastocytosis are associated with disease progression.Abstract:Multilineage involvement of bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis by the somatic KIT D816V mutation is present in a subset of adult indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) patients in association with a poorer prognosis. Here, we investigated the potential involvement of BM mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from ISM patients by the KIT D816V mutation and its potential impact on disease progression and outcome. This mutation was investigated in highly purified BM MSCs and other BM cell populations from 83 ISM patients followed for a median of 116 months. KIT D816V-mutated MSCs were detected in 22 of 83 cases. All MSC-mutated patients had multilineage KIT mutation (100% vs 30%, P = .0001) and they more frequently showed involvement of lymphoid plus myeloid BM cells (59% vs 22%; P = .03) and a polyclonal pattern of inactivation of the X-chromosome of KIT-mutated BM mast cells (64% vs 0%; P = .01) vs other multilineage ISM cases. Moreover, presence of KIT-mutated MSCs was associated with more advanced disease features, a greater rate of disease progression (50% vs 17%; P = .04), and a shorter progression-free survival (P <= .003). Overall, these results support the notion that ISM patients with mutated MSCs may have acquired the KIT mutation in a common pluripotent progenitor cell, prior to differentiation into MSCs and hematopoietic precursor cells, before the X-chromosome inactivation process occurs. From a clinical point of view, acquisition of the KIT mutation in an earlier BM precursor cell confers a significantly greater risk for disease progression and a poorer outcome.|Non-Cancer
ID:26626649|Title:Direct intrahepatic portocaval shunt for treatment of portal thrombosis and Budd-Chiari syndrome.Abstract:Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) refers to hepatic venous outflow obstruction that in severe cases can lead to acute liver failure prompting consideration of revascularization or transplantation. Here, a 22 year old female with angiographically proven BCS secondary to JAK2/V617F positive Polycythemia vera on therapeutic warfarin presented with acute liver failure (ALF). Imaging revealed a new, near complete thrombotic occlusion of the main portal vein with extension into the superior mesenteric vein. An emergent direct intrahepatic portocaval shunt (DIPS) was created and liver function promptly normalized. She has been maintained on rivaroxaban since that time. Serial assessment over 1 year demonstrated continued shunt patency and improved flow in the mesenteric vasculature on ultrasound as well as normal liver function. DIPS is a viable alternative in the treatment of ALF from BCS when standard recanalization is not feasible. Improved blood flow may also improve portal/mesenteric clot burden. While further investigation is needed, new targeted anticoagulants may be viable as a long term anticoagulation strategy.|Non-Cancer
ID:26706013|Title:Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.Abstract:Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of widespread hamartomatous lesions in various organs, including brain, skin, kidneys, heart, and eyes. Central nervous system is almost invariably involved, with up to 85% of patients presenting with epilepsy, and at least half of patients having intellectual disability or other neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder. TSC is caused by the mutation in one of the 2 genes TSC1, at 9q34, and TSC2, at 16p13.3. They respectively encode for hamartin and tuberin, which form an intracellular complex inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin. Mammalian target of rapamycin overactivation following the genetic defect determines the cell growth and proliferation responsible for TSC-related lesions, as well as the alterations in neuronal excitability and synaptogenesis leading to epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders. A causative mutation for the disorder is identified in about 85% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of TSC. Mosaicism and technology limits likely explain most of the no mutation identified cases. This review confirms that patients with TSC2 mutations considered as a group usually present a more severe phenotype, characterized by higher number of tubers, earlier age at seizure onset and higher prevalence of intellectual disability. However, the clinical phenotype of the disease presents a high variability, thus making the prediction of the phenotype on an individual basis still challenging. The increasing application of new molecular techniques to subjects with TSC has the potential to significantly reduce the rate of patients with no mutation demonstrated and to identify an increasing higher number of mutations. This would hopefully allow a better characterization of higher risk mutations, which might help clinicians to plan individualized surveillance plans. Furthermore, the increasing availability of disease registries to collect clinical and genetics data of patients help to define more valid and clinically oriented genotype or phenotype correlations.|Non-Cancer
ID:26748894|Title:Spleen enlargement is a risk factor for thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia: Evaluation on 1,297 patients.Abstract:Spleen enlargement, present in 10-20% of Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) patients at diagnosis, is a feature clinically easy to assess, confirmable by echography with a very low chance of misinterpretation. Nonetheless, the clinical and prognostic role of splenomegaly has been seldom evaluated. From 1979 to 2013, 1297 ET patients retrospectively collected in the database of the Lazio Cooperative Group and Bologna University Hospital were evaluable for spleen enlargement at diagnosis and included in the analysis. On the whole, spleen was enlarged in 172/1297 (13.0%) patients; in most cases (94.8%) splenomegaly was mild (<=5 cm). Patients with splenomegaly were younger, predominantly male, presented higher platelet count and JAK2V617F allele burden and had a lower incidence of concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. At least one thrombotic event during follow-up occurred in 97/1,125 (8.6%) patients without spleen enlargement compared to 27/172 (15.7%) patients with spleen enlargement (P = 0.003). Despite comparable use of cytoreductive/antiplatelet therapies in the two groups, the cumulative risk of thrombosis at 5 years was significantly higher in patients with baseline splenomegaly (9.8% versus 4.4% in patients without splenomegaly, P = 0.012). In multivariate analysis exploring risk factors for thrombosis, splenomegaly retained its negative prognostic role, together with previous thrombosis, leucocyte count and male gender. Baseline splenomegaly seems to be an independent additional risk factor for thrombosis in nonstrictly WHO-defined ET patients. This data could be useful in the real-life clinical management of these patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:26760961|Title:Hepatitis B virus X protein binding to hepsin promotes C3 production by inducing IL-6 secretion from hepatocytes.Abstract:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) is an important effector for HBV-associated pathogenesis. In this study, we identified hepsin as an HBx-interacting protein and investigated the effects of hepsin on HBx-mediated complement component 3 (C3) secretion in hepatocytes. In vivo and in vitro binding between HBx and hepsin was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. HBx synergized with hepsin to promote C3 production by potentiating interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion. Knockdown of endogenous hepsin attenuated C3 and IL-6 secretion induced by HBx in hepatic cells. In addition, levels of hepsin protein correlated positively with C3 expression in human non-tumor liver tissues. Further exploration revealed that HBx and hepsin increased C3 promoter activity by up-regulating the expression and phosphorylation of the transcription factor CAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP-beta), which binds to the IL-6/IL-1 response element in the C3 promoter. HBx and hepsin synergistically enhanced IL-6 mRNA levels and promoter activity by increasing the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Our findings show for the first time that binding between HBx and hepsin promotes C3 production by inducing IL-6 secretion in hepatocytes.|Non-Cancer
ID:26775773|Title:The spectrum of nephrocutaneous diseases and associations: Genetic causes of nephrocutaneous disease.Abstract:There are a significant number of diseases and treatment considerations of considerable importance relating to the skin and renal systems. This emphasizes the need for dermatologists in practice or in clinical training to be aware of these associations. Part I of this 2-part continuing medical education article reviews the genetic syndromes with both renal and cutaneous involvement that are most important for the dermatologist to be able to identify, manage, and appropriately refer to nephrology colleagues. Part II reviews the inflammatory syndromes with relevant renal manifestations and therapeutic agents commonly used by dermatologists that have drug-induced effects on or require close consideration of renal function. In addition, we will likewise review therapeutic agents commonly used by nephrologists that have drug-induced effects on the skin that dermatologists are likely to encounter in clinical practice. In both parts of this continuing medical education article, we discuss diagnosis, management, and appropriate referral to our nephrology colleagues in the context of each nephrocutaneous association. There are a significant number of dermatoses associated with renal abnormalities and disease, emphasizing the need for dermatologists to be keenly aware of their presence in order to avoid overlooking important skin conditions with potentially devastating renal complications. This review discusses important nephrocutaneous disease associations with recommendations for the appropriate urgency of referral to nephrology colleagues for diagnosis, surveillance, and early management of potential renal sequelae.|Non-Cancer
ID:26873836|Title:Natural History of Renal Angiomyolipoma (AML): Most Patients with Large AMLs >4cm Can Be Offered Active Surveillance as an Initial Management Strategy.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The natural history of renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is unknown. Treatment recommendations are based on smaller case series, with selection bias towards symptomatic patients. OBJECTIVE: To define the natural history of renal AML, including growth rates, size, and clinical presentation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used a unique radiology data-mining system (Montage; Montage Healthcare Systems, Philadelphia, PA, USA) to retrospectively review the radiology database in an academic health centre between 2002 and 2013 to identify all renal AMLs. Of 2741 patients identified, 447 with 582 AMLs had three or more imaging studies suitable for analysis. INTERVENTION: Angioembolisation, surgery, radiofrequency ablation, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary end point was the growth rate of untreated AMLs. We used a linear mixed-effects model to determine change in growth rate over time. We evaluated the association among growth rate, size, and patient factors as well as interventions. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The majority of untreated AMLs (>92%) had not grown at a median follow-up of 43 mo, with no difference in growth rates between AMLs <=4 and >4cm. Most AMLs occurred in female participants (80%) and were asymptomatic (91%). Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) was confirmed in 3.8% (n=17) and presented at an earlier age. Median size was 1cm but was significantly larger for TSC (5.5cm; p<0.001). Interventions were performed in 5.6% of patients. Limitations of our study include the retrospective design, selection against fat-poor AMLs, and lack of histology. CONCLUSIONS: This large, single-institution series on AMLs confirms that lesions >4cm do not require early intervention based on size alone. The vast majority are sporadic, asymptomatic, and initially harmless, with a negligible growth rate. Our findings support a policy of initial active surveillance for all asymptomatic AMLs. PATIENT SUMMARY: We evaluated the natural history and growth rates of renal AMLs. We found no difference in growth rates between AMLs >4 and <=4cm. Initial AS appears to be a safe management option.|Non-Cancer
ID:26911863|Title:A novel follicle-stimulating hormone receptor mutation causing primary ovarian failure: a fertility application of whole exome sequencing.Abstract:STUDY QUESTION: Can whole exome sequencing (WES) and in vitro validation studies be used to find the causative genetic etiology in a patient with primary ovarian failure and infertility? SUMMARY ANSWER: A novel follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) mutation was found by WES and shown, via in vitro flow cytometry studies, to affect membrane trafficking. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: WES may diagnose up to 25-35% of patients with suspected disorders of sex development (DSD). FSHR mutations are an extremely rare cause of 46, XX gonadal dysgenesis with primary amenorrhea due to hypergonadotropic ovarian failure. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A WES study was followed by flow cytometry studies of mutant protein function. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study subjects were two Turkish sisters with hypergonadotropic primary amenorrhea, their parents and two unaffected sisters. The affected siblings and both parents were sequenced (trio-WES). Transient transfection of HEK 293T cells was performed with a vector containing wild-type FSHR as well as the novel FSHR variant that was discovered by WES. Cellular localization of FSHR protein as well as FSH-stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) production was evaluated using flow cytometry. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Both affected sisters were homozygous for a previously unreported missense mutation (c.1222G>T, p.Asp408Tyr) in the second transmembrane domain of FSHR. Modeling predicted disrupted secondary structure. Flow cytometry demonstrated an average of 48% reduction in cell-surface signal detection (P < 0.01). The mean fluorescent signal for cAMP (second messenger of FSHR), stimulated by FSH, was reduced by 50% in the mutant-transfected cells (P < 0.01). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is an in vitro validation. All novel purported genetic variants can be clinically reported only as 'variants of uncertain significance' until more patients with a similar phenotype are discovered with the same variant. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: We report the first WES-discovered FSHR mutation, validated by quantitative flow cytometry. WES is a valuable tool for diagnosis of rare genetic diseases, and flow cytometry allows for quantitative characterization of purported variants. WES-assisted diagnosis allows for treatments aimed at the underlying molecular etiology of disease. Future studies should focus on pharmacological and assisted reproductive treatments aimed at the disrupted FSHR, so that patients with FSH resistance can be treated by personalized medicine.

ID:26942200|Title:Mechanical and Histological Effects of Resorbable Blasting Media Surface Treatment on the Initial Stability of Orthodontic Mini-Implants.Abstract:Introduction. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of resorbable blasting media (RBM) treatment on early stability of orthodontic mini-implants by mechanical, histomorphometric, and histological analyses. Methods. Ninety-six (64 for mechanical study and 32 for histological study and histomorphometric analysis) titanium orthodontic mini-implants (OMIs) with machined (machined group) or RBM-treated (CaP) surface (RBM group) were implanted in the tibiae of 24 rabbits. Maximum initial torque (MIT) was measured during insertion, and maximum removal torque (MRT) and removal angular momentum (RAM) were measured at 2 and 4 weeks after implantation. Bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone area (BA) were analyzed at 4 weeks after implantation. Results. RBM group exhibited significantly lower MIT and significantly higher MRT and RAM at 2 weeks than machined group. No significant difference in MRT, RAM, and BIC between the two groups was noted at 4 weeks, although BA was significantly higher in RBM group than in machined group. RBM group showed little bone resorption, whereas machined group showed new bone formation after bone resorption. Conclusions. RBM surface treatment can provide early stability of OMIs around 2 weeks after insertion, whereas stability of machined surface OMIs may decrease in early stages because of bone resorption, although it can subsequently recover by new bone apposition.|Non-Cancer
ID:26967226|Title:Metformin Facilitates Amyloid-beta Generation by beta- and gamma-Secretases via Autophagy Activation.Abstract:The evidence of strong pathological associations between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has increased in recent years. Contrary to suggestions that anti-diabetes drugs may have potential for treating AD, we demonstrate here that the insulin sensitizing anti-diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage ) increased the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), one of the major pathological hallmarks of AD, by promoting beta- and gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, we show that metformin caused autophagosome accumulation in Tg6799 AD model mice. Extremely high gamma-secretase activity was also detected in autophagic vacuoles, apparently a novel site of Abeta peptide generation. Together, these data suggest that metformin-induced accumulation of autophagosomes resulted in increased gamma-secretase activity and Abeta generation. Additional experiments indicated that metformin increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which activates autophagy by suppressing mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The suppression of mTOR then induces the abnormal accumulation of autophagosomes. We conclude that metformin, an anti-diabetes drug, may exacerbate AD pathogenesis by promoting amyloidogenic AbetaPP processing in autophagosomes.|Non-Cancer
ID:26970326|Title:Extending the Spectrum of Radiological Findings in Patients With Severe Osteopetrosis and Different Genetic Backgrounds.Abstract:PURPOSE: To evaluate radiological findings in a cohort of 22 patients with infantile malignant osteopetrosis in order to establish the correlation between radiological findings and different genetic backgrounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical files, genetic analysis results, and radiological examinations of children treated for osteopetrosis with bone marrow transplantation in a referral center in the last 5 years were retrospectively evaluated. The study received institutional review board (IRB) approval. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included in the study: 18 males, four females, ages 1 month-9 years 10 months, and the median age was 11 months (mean 23 months). There were 12 patients with different mutations in the TCIRG1 gene, five with mutations in the SNX10 gene, four children harbored RANK mutations, and one patient had a CLCN7 mutation. We noted more severe radiological findings in patients with TCIRG1 and RANK mutations, including fractures, osteopetrorickets, hydrocephalus, and hepatomegaly. Varus deformity of the femoral neck was seen exclusively in patients with a TCIRG1 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The variable genetic spectrum of osteopetrosis is associated with a variable radiological presentation. These correlations may be helpful for priorities in genetic analysis.|Non-Cancer

A 13-year-old boy with severe dural ectasia in the cervical spine underwent cervical posterior fusion from C1 to C5 for prevention of cervical spine fracture and spinal injury. We followed him up for 8 years after surgery. We measured the progression of the destruction on yearly MRI. The dural ectasia gradually progressed until 3 years postoperatively. Subsequently, no further enlargement of the dural sac occurred. At the 8-year follow-up examination, the patient had no limitations in the activities of daily life.|Non-Cancer
ID:27011217|Title:The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe: an update.Abstract:The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe is a rare X-linked multisystemic disorder characterized by the triad of congenital cataracts, intellectual disability, and proximal renal tubular dysfunction. Whereas the ocular manifestations and severe muscular hypotonia are the typical first diagnostic clues apparent at birth, the manifestations of incomplete renal Fanconi syndrome are often recognized only later in life. Other characteristic features are progressive severe growth retardation and behavioral problems, with tantrums. Many patients develop a debilitating arthropathy. Treatment is symptomatic, and the life span rarely exceeds 40 years. The causative oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe gene (OCRL) encodes the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase OCRL-1. OCRL variants have not only been found in classic Lowe syndrome, but also in patients with a predominantly renal phenotype classified as Dent disease type 2 (Dent-2). Recent data indicate that there is a phenotypic continuum between Dent-2 disease and Lowe syndrome, suggesting that there are individual differences in the ability to compensate for the loss of enzyme function. Extensive research has demonstrated that OCRL-1 is involved in multiple intracellular processes involving endocytic trafficking and actin skeleton dynamics. This explains the multi-organ manifestations of the disease. Still, the mechanisms underlying the wide phenotypic spectrum are poorly understood, and we are far from a causative therapy. In this review, we provide an update on clinical and molecular genetic findings in Lowe syndrome and the cellular and physiological functions of OCRL-1.|Non-Cancer
ID:27012200|Title:R-spondin 2 facilitates differentiation of proliferating chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes by enhancing Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in endochondral ossification.Abstract:Endochondral ossification is a crucial process for longitudinal growth of bones. Differentiating chondrocytes in growth cartilage form four sequential zones of proliferation, alignment into column, hypertrophy, and substitution of chondrocytes with osteoblasts. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is essential for differentiation of proliferating chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes in growth cartilage. R-spondin 2 (Rspo2), a member of R-spondin family, is an agonist for Wnt signaling, but its role in chondrocyte differentiation remains unknown. Here we report that growth cartilage of Rspo2-knockout mice shows a decreased amount of beta-catenin and increased amounts collagen type II (CII) and Sox9 in the abnormally extended proliferating zone. In contrast, expression of collagen type X (CX) in the hypertrophic zone remains unchanged. Differentiating chondrogenic ATDC5 cells, mimicking proliferating chondrocytes, upregulate Rspo2 and its putative receptor, Lgr5, in parallel. Addition of recombinant human Rspo2 to differentiating ATDC5 cells decreases expressions of Col2a1, Sox9, and Acan, as well as production of proteoglycans. In contrast, lentivirus-mediated knockdown of Rspo2 has the opposite effect. The effect of Rspo2 on chondrogenic differentiation is mediated by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and not by Wnt/PCP or Wnt/Ca(2+) signaling. We propose that Rspo2 activates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling to reduce Col2a1 and Sox9 and to facilitate differentiation of proliferating chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes in growth cartilage.|Non-Cancer
ID:27013236|Title:A POT1 mutation implicates defective telomere end fill-in and telomere truncations in Coats plus.Abstract:Coats plus (CP) can be caused by mutations in the CTC1 component of CST, which promotes polymerase alpha (polalpha)/primase-dependent fill-in throughout the genome and at telomeres. The cellular pathology relating to CP has not been established. We identified a homozygous POT1 S322L substitution (POT1(CP)) in two siblings with CP. POT1(CP)induced a proliferative arrest that could be bypassed by telomerase. POT1(CP)was expressed at normal levels, bound TPP1 and telomeres, and blocked ATR signaling. POT1(CP)was defective in regulating telomerase, leading to telomere elongation rather than the telomere shortening observed in other telomeropathies. POT1(CP)was also defective in the maintenance of the telomeric C strand, causing extended 3' overhangs and stochastic telomere truncations that could be healed by telomerase. Consistent with shortening of the telomeric C strand, metaphase chromosomes showed loss of telomeres synthesized by leading strand DNA synthesis. We propose that CP is caused by a defect in POT1/CST-dependent telomere fill-in. We further propose that deficiency in the fill-in step generates truncated telomeres that halt proliferation in cells lacking telomerase, whereas, in tissues expressing telomerase (e.g., bone marrow), the truncations are healed. The proposed etiology can explain why CP presents with features distinct from those associated with telomerase defects (e.g., dyskeratosis congenita).|Non-Cancer
ID:27070304|Title:Mastocytosis: a comprehensive insight.Abstract:Mastocytosis refers to a heterogeneous group of clinical disorders characterized by an abnormal accumulation of mast cells (MCs) in various tissues. The skin is the organ most frequently involved, but all organs may be affected. The clinical signs and symptoms are produced by the functional effects of mast cell-derived mediators and the anatomical distribution of the mast cells. The 2008 WHO-classification defines 7 categories of mastocytosis. Skin disease, with or without systemic involvement, is by far the most common form of childhood mastocytosis. Measurement of serum tryptase is important in the diagnostic algorithm of pediatric mastocytosis. In children with tryptase <20 ng/mL, the diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) may be decided upon without bone marrow examination (BME), unless other signs of SM are present. If the baseline tryptase level exceeds 100 ng/mL, a BME should be considered regardless of age. If the serum tryptase is 20-100 ng/mL in children without other signs of SM, the provisional diagnosis "mastocytosis in the skin" (MIS) can be established and monitored until puberty. If MIS remains present after puberty, a BME should be performed. In adult-onset mastocytosis a complete staging and application of the systemic mastocytosis criteria should always be performed. Treatment is mainly directed at alleviation of symptoms. As c-kit mutations prove to be very important in the pathogenesis of mastocytosis, targeted therapies using kit inhibitors may evolve as important future therapeutic options.|Non-Cancer
ID:27072151|Title:Recurrence after robotic myomectomy: is it associated with use of GnRH agonist?Abstract:Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy is used before myomectomy to decrease the size of the fibroids, but its association with fibroid recurrence postoperatively remains unsettled. We undertook a retrospective study of robotic-assisted myomectomy (RM) patients at our academic medical center to determine symptomatic recurrence and reoperation rates in those who did versus did not receive preoperative GnRH therapy. Only patients, who had their index myomectomy at least 2 years prior to the chart review, were included in this study. Of 118 RM patients identified between January 2005 and December 2009, 17 patients (14.4 %) had symptomatic recurrence as early as 5 months to as late as 30 months postoperatively. The symptomatic recurrence group had significantly higher preoperative GnRH use (35 vs 9 % non-recurrence; p = 0.009). A total of 7.6 % of all patients underwent reoperation. GnRH agonist use was significantly higher in the reoperation group (56 vs 9 % no reoperation; p = 0.002). Cavity entry during the initial surgery was also more frequent in the reoperation group (56 vs 20 %; p = 0.030), whereas the presence of multiple fibroids, size of the largest leiomyoma, and uterine volume were not statistically different between groups. Our study is among the earliest to report RM reoperation rates in patients receiving preoperative GnRH therapy, showing that the role of GnRH agonist therapy to shrink myomas may not be beneficial when measured against risk of disease recurrence.|Non-Cancer
ID:27103127|Title:Romiplostim in children with immune thrombocytopenia: a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The thrombopoietin receptor agonist romiplostim could be an effective treatment in symptomatic children with persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia. We aimed to assess whether romiplostim is safe and effective in children with immune thrombocytopenia of more than 6 months' duration. METHODS: In this phase 3 double-blind study, eligible participants were children with immune thrombocytopenia aged 1 year to 17 years and mean platelet counts 30 x 10(9)/L or less (mean of two measurements during the screening period) with no single count greater than 35 x 10(9)/L, and were recruited from 27 sites in the USA, Canada, and Australia. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) through the interactive voice response system to receive weekly romiplostim or placebo for 24 weeks stratified by age (1 year to <6 years, 6 years to <12 years, 12 years to <18 years), adjusting the dose weekly from 1 mug/kg to 10 mug/kg to target platelet counts of 50-200 x 10(9)/L. Patients and investigators were blinded to the treatment assignment. The primary analysis included all randomised patients and the safety analysis included all randomised patients who received at least one dose of investigational product. The primary endpoint, durable platelet response, was defined as achievement of weekly platelet responses (platelet counts >=50 x 10(9)/L without rescue drug use in the preceding 4 weeks) in 6 or more of the final 8 weeks (weeks 18-25). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 01444417. FINDINGS: Between Jan 24, 2012, and Sept 3, 2014, 62 patients were randomly assigned; 42 to romiplostim and 20 to placebo. Durable platelet response was seen in 22 (52%) patients in the romiplostim group and two (10%) in the placebo group (p=0 002, odds ratio 9 1 [95% CI 1 9-43 2]). Durable platelet response rates with romiplostim by age were 38% (3/8) for 1 year to younger than 6 years, 56% (10/18) for 6 years to younger than 12 years, and 56% (9/16) for 12 years to younger than 18 years. One (5%) of 19 patients in the placebo group had serious adverse events compared with 10 (24%) of 42 patients in the romiplostim group. Of these serious adverse events, headache and thrombocytosis, in one (2%) of 42 patients in the romiplostim group, were considered treatment related. No patients withdrew due to adverse events. INTERPRETATION: In children with chronic immune thrombocytopenia, romiplostim induced a high rate of platelet response with no new safety signals.

ID:27135461|Title:Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonist Use in Children: Data From the Pediatric ITP Consortium of North America ICON2 Study.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Data on second-line treatment options for pediatric patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) are limited. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RA) provide a nonimmunosuppressive option for children who require an increased platelet count. PROCEDURE: We performed a multicenter retrospective study of pediatric ITP patients followed at ITP Consortium of North America (ICON) sites to characterize TPO-RA use. RESULTS: Seventy-nine children had a total of 87 treatments (28 eltrombopag, 43 romiplostim, and eight trialed on both). The majority had primary ITP (82%) and most (60.8%) had chronic ITP. However, 22% had persistent ITP and 18% had newly diagnosed ITP. During the first 3 months of treatment, 89% achieved a platelet count >= 50 x 10(9) /l (86% romiplostim, 81% eltrombopag, P = 0.26) at least once in the absence of rescue therapy. The average time to a response was 6.4 weeks for romiplostim and 7.0 weeks for eltrombopag (P = 0.83). Only 40% of patients demonstrated a stable response with consistent dosing over time. An intermittent response with constant dose titration was seen in 15%, and an initial response that waned to no response was seen in 13%. Significant adverse events were minimal with the exception of two patients with thrombotic events and one who developed a neutralizing antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that TPO-RA agents are being used in children with ITP of varying duration and severity. The response was similar to clinical trials, but the sustainability of response varied. Future studies need to focus on the ideal timing and rationale for these medications in pediatric patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:27215853|Title:Telomere-associated aging disorders.Abstract:Telomeres are dynamic nucleoprotein-DNA structures that cap and protect linear chromosome ends. Several monogenic inherited diseases that display features of human premature aging correlate with shortened telomeres, and are referred to collectively as telomeropathies. These disorders have overlapping symptoms and a common underlying mechanism of telomere dysfunction, but also exhibit variable symptoms and age of onset, suggesting they fall along a spectrum of disorders. Primary telomeropathies are caused by defects in the telomere maintenance machinery, whereas secondary telomeropathies have some overlapping symptoms with primary telomeropathies, but are generally caused by mutations in DNA repair proteins that contribute to telomere preservation. Here we review both the primary and secondary telomeropathies, discuss potential mechanisms for tissue specificity and age of onset, and highlight outstanding questions in the field and future directions toward elucidating disease etiology and developing therapeutic strategies.|Non-Cancer
ID:27216612|Title:Everolimus improves neuropsychiatric symptoms in a patient with tuberous sclerosis carrying a novel TSC2 mutation.Abstract:Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by multiple symptoms including neuropsychological deficits such as seizures, intellectual disability, and autism. TSC is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which enhance activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Recent studies have suggested that mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin can reverse TSC-associated deficits in rodent models of TSC. In addition, clinical trials are ongoing to test the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors toward the psychiatric symptoms associated with TSC. Here, we report a case study of a Korean patient with TSC, who exhibited multiple symptoms including frequent seizures, intellectual disability, language delays, and social problems. We performed whole exome sequencing and identified a novel small deletion mutation in TSC2. Expressing the novel deletion mutant in HEK293T cells significantly increased mTOR pathway activation. Furthermore, everolimus treatment showed not only reduction in SEGA size, but dramatically improved behavioral deficits including autism related behaviors in the patient. In summary, we identified a novel small deletion mutation in TSC2 associated with severe TSC in a Korean family that enhances the activation of mTOR signaling in vitro. Everolimus treatment improved behavioral deficits in the patient.|Non-Cancer
ID:27241812|Title:Angiopoietin-2 mediates thrombin-induced monocyte adhesion and endothelial permeability.Abstract:UNLABELLED: Essentials Mechanism of thrombin-induced inflammation is not fully understood. Thrombin induced monocyte adhesion and barrier loss require Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2). Ang-2 mediates vessel leakage and monocyte adhesion through SHP-2/p38MAPK pathway. Calcium dependent SHP2/p38MAPK activation regulates Ang-2 expression through a feedback loop. SUMMARY: Background Thrombin imparts an inflammatory phenotype to the endothelium by promoting increased monocyte adhesion and vascular permeability. However, the molecular players that govern these events are incompletely understood. Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) has a role, if any, in regulating inflammatory signals initiated by thrombin. Methods Assessment of vascular leakage by Miles assay was performed by intra-dermal injection on the foot paw. Surface levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were determined by flow cytometry. Overexpression, knockdown and phosphorylation of proteins were determined by Western blotting. Results In time-course experiments, thrombin-stimulated Ang-2 up-regulation, peaked prior to the expression of adhesion molecule ICAM-1 in human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells (HUVECs). Knockdown of Ang-2 blocked both thrombin-induced monocyte adhesion and ICAM-1 expression. In addition, Ang-2(-/-) mice displayed defective vascular leakage when treated with thrombin. Introducing Ang-2 protein in Ang-2(-/-) mice failed to recover a wild-type phenotype. Mechanistically, Ang-2 appears to regulate the thrombin-activated calcium spike that is required for tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and p38 MAPK activation. Further, down-regulation of SHP2 attenuated both thrombin-induced Ang-2 expression and monocyte adhesion. Down-regulation of the adaptor protein Gab1, a co-activator of SHP2, as well as overexpression of the Gab1 mutant incapable of interacting with SHP2 (YFGab1), inhibited thrombin-mediated effects, including downstream activation of p38 MAPK, which in turn was required for Ang-2 expression. Conclusions The data establish an essential role of the Gab1/SHP2/p38MAPK signaling pathway and Ang-2 in regulating thrombin-induced monocyte adhesion and vascular leakage.|Non-Cancer
ID:27255792|Title:MutSbeta promotes trinucleotide repeat expansion by recruiting DNA polymerase beta to nascent (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins for error-prone DNA synthesis.Abstract:Expansion of (CAG) (CTG) repeats causes a number of familial neurodegenerative disorders. Although the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown, components involved in DNA mismatch repair, particularly mismatch recognition protein MutSbeta (a MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer), are implicated in (CAG) (CTG) repeat expansion. In addition to recognizing small insertion-deletion loop-outs, MutSbeta also specifically binds DNA hairpin imperfect heteroduplexes formed within (CAG)n (CTG)n sequences. However, whether or not and how MutSbeta binding triggers expansion of (CAG) (CTG) repeats remain unknown. We show here that purified recombinant MutSbeta physically interacts with DNA polymerase beta (Polbeta) and stimulates Polbeta-catalyzed (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpin retention. Consistent with these in vitro observations, MutSbeta and Polbeta interact with each other in vivo, and colocalize at (CAG) (CTG) repeats during DNA replication. Our data support a model for error-prone processing of (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins by MutSbeta and Polbeta during DNA replication and/or repair: MutSbeta recognizes (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins formed in the nascent DNA strand, and recruits Polbeta to the complex, which then utilizes the hairpin as a primer for extension, leading to (CAG) (CTG) repeat expansion. This study provides a novel mechanism for trinucleotide repeat expansion in both dividing and non-dividing cells.|Non-Cancer
ID:27259010|Title:CTNNB1 Mutations and Estrogen Receptor Expression in Neuromuscular Choristoma and Its Associated Fibromatosis.Abstract:Neuromuscular choristoma (NMC) is a very rare, developmental malformation characterized by the endoneurial intercalation of mature muscle fibers among peripheral nerve fibers. NMC typically arises in the major proximal peripheral nerves, most commonly the sciatic nerve, and may involve the lumbosacral and brachial plexus. Patients present clinically with progressive neuropathy or plexopathy. NMC is strongly associated with development of a fibromatosis, histologically identical to conventional desmoid-type fibromatosis (NMC-fibromatosis). The development of NMC-fibromatosis is often precipitated by iatrogenic trauma (ie, biopsy). Desmoid-type fibromatosis is characterized by CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations, which result in aberrant nuclear beta-catenin localization and dysregulated canonical Wnt signaling. In contrast, the pathogenesis of NMC and NMC-fibromatosis is unknown. Desmoid-type fibromatosis expresses estrogen receptors (ER), specifically the ER-beta isoform (ERbeta), and endocrine therapies may be used in surgically unresectable cases. In contrast, the ER expression profile of NMC-fibromatosis is unknown. We evaluated a series of NMC and NMC-fibromatosis for CTNNB1 mutations, beta-catenin expression, and ER isoform expression. Five NMCs occurred in 2 female and 3 male patients (median age: 14 y, range <1 to 42 y), as masses involving the sciatic nerve (N=4) or brachial plexus (N=1). Four (of 5) NMCs had CTNNB1 mutations: 3 c.134 C>T (p.S45F) and 1 c.121 A>G (p.T41A). Four patients subsequently developed NMC-fibromatosis, and all 4 cases contained CTNNB1 mutations, including 1 p.T41A and 3 p.S45F mutations. In 3 patients, the NMC and NMC-fibromatosis had identical CTNNB1 mutations. Only 1 NMC had no detectable CTNNB1 mutation; however, the patient's subsequent NMC-fibromatosis had a CTNNB1 p.T41A mutation. All NMC and NMC-fibromatosis showed aberrant nuclear localization of beta-catenin, nuclear ERbeta expression, and no ERalpha expression. The presence of CTNNB1 mutations both in NMC and NMC-fibromatosis may be a shared molecular genetic abnormality underlying their pathogenesis.|Non-Cancer
ID:27311832|Title:CREBBP mutations in individuals without Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome phenotype.Abstract:Mutations in CREBBP cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. By using exome sequencing, and by using Sanger in one patient, CREBBP mutations were detected in 11 patients who did not, or only in a very limited manner, resemble Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. The combined facial signs typical for Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome were absent, none had broad thumbs, and three had only somewhat broad halluces. All had apparent developmental delay (being the reason for molecular analysis); five had short stature and seven had microcephaly. The facial characteristics were variable; main characteristics were short palpebral fissures, telecanthi, depressed nasal ridge, short nose, anteverted nares, short columella, and long philtrum. Six patients had autistic behavior, and two had self-injurious behavior. Other symptoms were recurrent upper airway infections (n = 5), feeding problems (n = 7) and impaired hearing (n = 7). Major malformations occurred infrequently. All patients had a de novo missense mutation in the last part of exon 30 or beginning of exon 31 of CREBBP, between base pairs 5,128 and 5,614 (codons 1,710 and 1,872). No missense or truncating mutations in this region have been described to be associated with the classical Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome phenotype. No functional studies have (yet) been performed, but we hypothesize that the mutations disturb protein-protein interactions by altering zinc finger function. We conclude that patients with missense mutations in this specific CREBBP region show a phenotype that differs substantially from that in patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, and may prove to constitute one (or more) separate entities.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.|Non-Cancer
ID:27323230|Title:The cilium: a cellular antenna with an influence on obesity risk.Abstract:Primary cilia are organelles that are present on many different cell types, either transiently or permanently. They play a crucial role in receiving signals from the environment and passing these signals to other parts of the cell. In that way, they are involved in diverse processes such as adipocyte differentiation and olfactory sensation. Mutations in genes coding for ciliary proteins often have pleiotropic effects and lead to clinical conditions, ciliopathies, with multiple symptoms. In this study, we reviewed observations from ciliopathies with obesity as one of the symptoms. It shows that variation in cilia-related genes is itself not a major cause of obesity in the population but may be a part of the multifactorial aetiology of this complex condition. Both common polymorphisms and rare deleterious variants may contribute to the obesity risk. Genotype-phenotype relationships have been noticed. Among the ciliary genes, obesity differs with regard to severity and age of onset, which may relate to the influence of each gene on the balance between pro- and anti-adipogenic processes. Analysis of the function and location of the proteins encoded by these ciliary genes suggests that obesity is more linked to activities at the basal area of the cilium, including initiation of the intraflagellar transport, but less to the intraflagellar transport itself. Regarding the role of cilia, three possible mechanistic processes underlying obesity are described: adipogenesis, neuronal food intake regulation and food odour perception.|Non-Cancer
ID:27346689|Title:Large-Scale Exome-wide Association Analysis Identifies Loci for White Blood Cell Traits and Pleiotropy with Immune-Mediated Diseases.Abstract:White blood cells play diverse roles in innate and adaptive immunity. Genetic association analyses of phenotypic variation in circulating white blood cell (WBC) counts from large samples of otherwise healthy individuals can provide insights into genes and biologic pathways involved in production, differentiation, or clearance of particular WBC lineages (myeloid, lymphoid) and also potentially inform the genetic basis of autoimmune, allergic, and blood diseases. We performed an exome array-based meta-analysis of total WBC and subtype counts (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils) in a multi-ancestry discovery and replication sample of ~157,622 individuals from 25 studies. We identified 16 common variants (8 of which were coding variants) associated with one or more WBC traits, the majority of which are pleiotropically associated with autoimmune diseases. Based on functional annotation, these loci included genes encoding surface markers of myeloid, lymphoid, or hematopoietic stem cell differentiation (CD69, CD33, CD87), transcription factors regulating lineage specification during hematopoiesis (ASXL1, IRF8, IKZF1, JMJD1C, ETS2-PSMG1), and molecules involved in neutrophil clearance/apoptosis (C10orf54, LTA), adhesion (TNXB), or centrosome and microtubule structure/function (KIF9, TUBD1). Together with recent reports of somatic ASXL1 mutations among individuals with idiopathic cytopenias or clonal hematopoiesis of undetermined significance, the identification of a common regulatory 3' UTR variant of ASXL1 suggests that both germline and somatic ASXL1 mutations contribute to lower blood counts in otherwise asymptomatic individuals. These association results shed light on genetic mechanisms that regulate circulating WBC counts and suggest a prominent shared genetic architecture with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.|Non-Cancer

In this article, we discuss three cases where lethal skeletal dysplasia was suspected and Blomstrand dysplasia was diagnosed by autopsy. Antenatal ultrasound findings include increased nuchal translucency, tetramicromelia and polyhydramnios. Radiological hallmark is advanced skeletal maturation and bone sclerosis. Histology of long bones revealed narrow cartilagenous cap and changes in the physeal growth zone which showed severe hypoplasia and disorganization of proliferative phase and hypertrophic phase. Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in PTHR1 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this chondrodysplasia.|Non-Cancer
ID:27417417|Title:The ER membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 is a positive regulator of T-cell immunity.Abstract:Identification of positive regulators of T-cell immunity induced during autoimmune diseases is critical for developing novel therapies. The endoplasmic reticulum resident ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 has recently emerged as a critical regulator of dendritic cell antigen presentation, but its role in T-cell immunity is unknown. Here we show that genetic deletion of Hrd1 in mice inhibits T-cell proliferation, production of IL-2, and differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, and consequently protects mice from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Hrd1 facilitates T-cell proliferation by the destruction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1), and deletion of p27(kip1) in Hrd1-null T-cells rescues proliferative capacity but not the production of cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-gamma and IL-17. T-cell expression of Hrd1 is higher in patients with multiple sclerosis than in healthy individuals, and knockdown of Hrd1 in human CD4(+) T cells inhibits activation and differentiation to Th1 and Th17 cells. Our study identifies Hrd1 as a previously unappreciated positive regulator of T cells and implies that Hrd1 is a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases.|Non-Cancer
ID:27441947|Title:The impact of mosaicism in preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD): approaches to PGD for dominant disorders in couples without family history.Abstract:OBJECTIVES: Mosaicism in certain dominant disorders may result in a 'non-Mendelian' transmission for the causative mutation. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is available for patients with inherited disorders to achieve an unaffected pregnancy. We present our experience for two female patients with different dominantly inherited autosomal disorders; neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and tuberous sclerosis complex type 2 (TSC2). METHODS: PGD protocol development was carried out using single cells from the patients. PGD was carried out on polar bodies and different embryonic cells. RESULTS: Protocol development for NF1 using lymphocytes from the patient suggested mosaicism for the mutation. This was supported further by quantitative fluorescent-PCR performed on genomic DNA. During PGD, polar bodies and blastomeres lacked the mutation that probably was absent or present at very low levels in the patient's germline. Single lymphocyte analysis during protocol development for TSC2 did not indicate mosaicism; however, analysis of single buccal cells and multiple embryo biopsies across two consecutive IVF/PGD cycles confirmed gonosomal mosaicism. CONCLUSIONS: The trend in PGD is for blastocyst biopsy followed by whole genome amplification, eliminating single cell analysis. In the case of certain dominantly inherited disorders, pre-PGD single cell analysis is beneficial to identify potential mosaicism that ensures robust protocols.   2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.|Non-Cancer
ID:27445228|Title:Erdheim-Chester disease with novel gene mutations discovered as an incidental finding in explanted liver of a patient with hepatitis C cirrhosis: A case report and literature review.Abstract:Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by xanthogranulomatous infiltration of foamy histiocytes frequently involving bone and other organ systems. We herein report a unique case of ECD discovered incidentally in an explanted liver in a 65-year-old male with end-stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C cirrhosis. Histological examination and immunohistochemical studies in the explanted liver revealed prominent foamy histiocytes that were CD68 positive, but CD1a and S100 negative. Mutational hotspot analysis of the explanted liver using a panel of 47 most common cancer-related genes performed by next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed likely somatic mutations in the PDGFRA, PTEN, and HNF1A genes, but no BRAF codon 600 mutations were detected. The bone marrow showed similar findings as in the liver. Whole body PET and bone scans demonstrated increased heterogeneous uptake in bilateral humeral and femoral diaphysis, most compatible with ECD. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of ECD that involves mainly bone marrow and liver with novel genomic alterations. Our case highlights the diversity and complexity of this disease entity and the importance of multi-modality approach integrating clinical and radiologic features with histopathologic and molecular/genomic findings.|Non-Cancer
ID:27470532|Title:Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Associated with Vascular Anomalies or Overgrowth.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway is the underlying pathogenic mechanism in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Other syndromes caused by genetic alterations in this pathway frequently manifest as vascular anomalies or asymmetric overgrowth. Rarely, these features have been documented in TSC. OBJECTIVE: To collate cases of TSC with vascular anomaly or overgrowth that have been published and to assemble additional recent cases, as this finding has been underreported. METHODS: TSC cases from three pediatric dermatology referral centers on two continents were reviewed to identify individuals noted to have hemihypertrophy or vascular anomalies. RESULTS: We report five additional cases of TSC associated with vascular anomalies or overgrowth that contribute to our understanding of some of the pathways and treatments involved in vascular anomalies. CONCLUSION: Hemihypertrophy and vascular anomalies may be more frequent in the setting of TSC than previously appreciated. A common pathogenetic mechanism may tie these manifestations together.|Non-Cancer
ID:27488869|Title:Erdheim-Chester Disease with Emperipolesis: A Unique Case Involving the Heart.Abstract:Histiocytosis is an uncommon disease characterized by excessive accumulation of histiocytes. Here, we report a rare case of non-Langerhans-cell histiocytosis in a 51-year-old woman who presented with severe symptoms of pericardial effusion. Radiologic investigation also detected multiple bone (lower limbs, vertebrae, ribs, and ilium) lesions. Resected pericardium showed abundant mono- or multi-nucleated non-foamy histiocytes (CD68+/CD163+/S-100+/CD1alpha-/langerin-) in a fibroinflammatory background. The histiocytes demonstrated emperipolesis of lymphocytes, a hallmark feature of Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD). However, molecular analysis revealed a BRAF V600E mutation of the proliferating histiocytes, highlighting the neoplastic features frequently observed in another non-Langerhans-cell histiocytosis known as Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD). We consider this case to be a unique presentation of ECD harboring some RDD-like cells with emperipolesis, but not a case of RDD with a BRAF mutation concerning its clinical manifestation (involvement of the heart and bones) and neoplastic features.|Non-Cancer
ID:27498064|Title:Defining a new aggressiveness classification and using NFATc1 localization as a prognostic factor in cherubism.Abstract:Cherubism is a rare genetic disease characterized by bilateral giant cell reparative granuloma of the jaws consisting of a fibrotic stroma with giant multinucleated cells (GMCs) and osteoclastic features. Cherubism severity is highly variable, and recurrence after surgery is the most important risk. Currently, there are no prognostic indicators. The aims of this study were to evaluate the osteoclastogenesis phenotype by histologic examination of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) localization and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and to correlate the results to disease aggressiveness to define prognostic indicators. Based on cherubism evolution 1 year after surgery, 3 classes of cherubism aggressiveness were identified: mild (group A), moderate (group B), and severe (group C). Histologically, in grade A and B cherubism lesions, GMCs were negative for both TRAP activity and NFATc1 nuclear localization. In contrast, in grade C cherubism lesions, GMCs were all positive for TRAP activity and NFATc1 nuclear localization and displayed osteoclast-like features. Other histopathologic findings were not different among the 3 groups. Our results establish that TRAP activity and NFTAc1 nuclear localization are associated with aggressive cherubism and therefore could be added to routine pathologic examination to aid in prognosis and management of the disease. The finding of NFATc1 nuclear localization in aggressive tumors supports the addition of anticalcineurin treatment to the therapeutic arsenal for cherubism.|Non-Cancer

ID:27558955|Title:Molecular hydrogen suppresses activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.Abstract:Molecular hydrogen (H2) is effective for many diseases. However, molecular bases of H2 have not been fully elucidated. Cumulative evidence indicates that H2 acts as a gaseous signal modulator. We found that H2 suppresses activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by promoting phosphorylation and degradation omicronf beta-catenin. Either complete inhibition of GSK3 or mutations at CK1- and GSK3-phosphorylation sites of beta-catenin abolished the suppressive effect of H2. H2 did not increase GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, indicating that H2 has no direct effect on GSK3 itself. Knock-down of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or Axin1, which form the beta-catenin degradation complex, minimized the suppressive effect of H2 on beta-catenin accumulation. Accordingly, the effect of H2 requires CK1/GSK3-phosphorylation sites of beta-catenin, as well as the beta-catenin degradation complex comprised of CK1, GSK3, APC, and Axin1. We additionally found that H2 reduces the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in human osteoarthritis chondrocytes. Oral intake of H2 water tended to ameliorate cartilage degradation in a surgery-induced rat osteoarthritis model through attenuating beta-catenin accumulation. We first demonstrate that H2 suppresses abnormally activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, which accounts for the protective roles of H2 in a fraction of diseases.|Non-Cancer
ID:27651169|Title:Gene panel sequencing improves the diagnostic work-up of patients with idiopathic erythrocytosis and identifies new mutations.Abstract:Erythrocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by increased red cell mass and elevated hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit. Several genetic variants have been identified as causes for erythrocytosis in genes belonging to different pathways including oxygen sensing, erythropoiesis and oxygen transport. However, despite clinical investigation and screening for these mutations, the cause of disease cannot be found in a considerable number of patients, who are classified as having idiopathic erythrocytosis. In this study, we developed a targeted next-generation sequencing panel encompassing the exonic regions of 21 genes from relevant pathways (~79 Kb) and sequenced 125 patients with idiopathic erythrocytosis. The panel effectively screened 97% of coding regions of these genes, with an average coverage of 450x. It identified 51 different rare variants, all leading to alterations of protein sequence, with 57 out of 125 cases (45.6%) having at least one of these variants. Ten of these were known erythrocytosis-causing variants, which had been missed following existing diagnostic algorithms. Twenty-two were novel variants in erythrocytosis-associated genes (EGLN1, EPAS1, VHL, BPGM, JAK2, SH2B3) and in novel genes included in the panel (e.g. EPO, EGLN2, HIF3A, OS9), some with a high likelihood of functionality, for which future segregation, functional and replication studies will be useful to provide further evidence for causality. The rest were classified as polymorphisms. Overall, these results demonstrate the benefits of using a gene panel rather than existing methods in which focused genetic screening is performed depending on biochemical measurements: the gene panel improves diagnostic accuracy and provides the opportunity for discovery of novel variants.|Non-Cancer
ID:27666661|Title:Molecular screening strategies for NF1-like syndromes with cafe-au-lait macules (Review).Abstract:Multiple cafe-au-lait macules (CALM) are usually associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most common hereditary disorders. However, a group of genetic disorders presenting with CALM have mutations that are involved in human skin pigmentation regulation signaling pathways, including KIT ligand/KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase. These disorders, which include Legius syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines or LEOPARD syndrome, and familial progressive hyperpigmentation) are difficult to distinguish from NF1 at early stages, using skin appearance alone. Furthermore, certain syndromes are clinically overlapping and molecular testing is a vital diagnostic method. The present review aims to provide an overview of these 'NF1-like' inherited diseases and recommend a cost-effective strategy for making a clear diagnosis among these diseases with an ambiguous borderline.|Non-Cancer
ID:27698644|Title:Proximal Interphalangeal Joint Fibromatosis After Pyrocarbon Implant Insertion: A Case Report.Abstract:Background: Pyrocarbon implants represent an increasingly popular method to treat proximal interphalangeal joint dysfunction. To this point, no association has been shown between pyrocarbon biomaterials and fibromatosis. We present a potentially serious and destructive complication associated with pyrocarbon arthroplasty. Methods: We demonstrate a clinical case involving pyrocarbon arthroplasty and subsequent fibromatosis development in an otherwise healthy 23-year-old female. To present this association, we illustrate the diagnostic workup involved in a rapidly expanding soft tissue mass of the hand and explain the appropriate treatment. Results: Pyrocarbon arthroplasty was associated with development of locally destructive fibromatosis confirmed by histopathological examination. Treatment involved wide resection with preservation of local structures. Conclusion: We describe the first association between fibromatosis and pyrocarbon biomaterial. Due to fibromatosis destructive effects, clinicians should be aware of potential complications associated with these materials and know how to accurately diagnose and treat these lesions.|Non-Cancer
ID:27711228|Title:DNA/MVA Vaccination of HIV-1 Infected Participants with Viral Suppression on Antiretroviral Therapy, followed by Treatment Interruption: Elicitation of Immune Responses without Control of Re-Emergent Virus.Abstract:GV-TH-01, a Phase 1 open-label trial of a DNA prime:Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) boost vaccine (GOVX-B11), was undertaken in HIV infected participants on antiretroviral treatment (ART) to evaluate safety and vaccine-elicited T cell responses, and explore the ability of elicited CD8+ T cells to control viral rebound during analytical treatment interruption (TI). Nine men who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 18 months of seroconversion and had sustained plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for at least 6 months were enrolled. Median age was 38 years, median pre-ART HIV-1 RNA was 140,000 copies/ml and mean baseline CD4 count was 755/mul. Two DNA, followed by 2 MVA, inoculations were given 8 weeks apart. Eight subjects completed all vaccinations and TI. Clinical and laboratory adverse events were generally mild, with no serious or grade 4 events. Only reactogenicity events were considered related to study drug. No treatment emergent viral resistance was seen. The vaccinations did not reduce viral reservoirs and virus re-emerged in all participants during TI, with a median time to re-emergence of 4 weeks. Eight of 9 participants had CD8+ T cells that could be stimulated by vaccine-matched Gag peptides prior to vaccination. Vaccinations boosted these responses as well as eliciting previously undetected CD8+ responses. Elicited T cells did not display signs of exhaustion. During TI, temporal patterns of viral re-emergence and Gag-specific CD8+ T cell expansion suggested that vaccine-specific CD8+ T cells had been stimulated by re-emergent virus in only 2 of 8 participants. In these 2, transient decreases in viremia were associated with Gag selection in known CD8+ T cell epitopes. We hypothesize that escape mutations, already archived in the viral reservoir, plus a poor ability of CD8+ T cells to traffic to and control virus at sites of re-emergence, limited the therapeutic efficacy of the DNA/MVA vaccine.

ID:27737891|Title:The NLRP3 inflammasome functions as a driver of the myelodysplastic syndrome phenotype.Abstract:Despite genetic heterogeneity, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) share features of cytological dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis. We report that a hallmark of MDSs is activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which drives clonal expansion and pyroptotic cell death. Independent of genotype, MDS hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) overexpress inflammasome proteins and manifest activated NLRP3 complexes that direct activation of caspase-1, generation of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-18, and pyroptotic cell death. Mechanistically, pyroptosis is triggered by the alarmin S100A9 that is found in excess in MDS HSPCs and bone marrow plasma. Further, like somatic gene mutations, S100A9-induced signaling activates NADPH oxidase (NOX), increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that initiate cation influx, cell swelling, and beta-catenin activation. Notably, knockdown of NLRP3 or caspase-1, neutralization of S100A9, and pharmacologic inhibition of NLRP3 or NOX suppress pyroptosis, ROS generation, and nuclear beta-catenin in MDSs and are sufficient to restore effective hematopoiesis. Thus, alarmins and founder gene mutations in MDSs license a common redox-sensitive inflammasome circuit, which suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention.|Non-Cancer
ID:27777166|Title:Rathke Cleft Cyst with Evidence of Rupture into Subarachnoid Space.Abstract:BACKGROUND: A Rathke cleft cyst (RCC) with nonhemorrhagic rupture mimicking pituitary apoplexy has been reported rarely. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 52-year-old woman, previously diagnosed with asymptomatic RCC, came to us with a severe headache, along with visual dysfunction and symptoms of pituitary insufficiency. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse hyperintensity in the cerebral cisterns, whereas watery clear cerebrospinal fluid was obtained by lumbar puncture. Surgery performed 1 month after onset revealed a nonhemorrhagic lesion, with a final diagnosis of nonhemorrhagic RCC rupture. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that nonhemorrhagic RCC rupture and subsequent leakage of the contents into subarachnoid space were the underlying pathogenesis in the present case of RCC resembling apoplexy.|Non-Cancer

ID:27815897|Title:Synchronization and Desynchronization of Cells by Interventions on the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint.Abstract:Cell cycle checkpoints are surveillance mechanisms that sequentially and continuously monitor cell cycle progression thereby contributing to the preservation of genetic stability. Among them, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents the occurrence of abnormal divisions by halting the metaphase to anaphase transition following the detection of erroneous microtubules-kinetochore attachment(s). Most synchronization strategies are based on the activation of cell cycle checkpoints to enrich the population of cells in a specific phase of the cell cycle. Here, we develop a two-step protocol of sequential cell synchronization and desynchronization employing antimitotic SAC-inducing agents (i.e., nocodazole or paclitaxel) in combination with the depletion of the SAC kinase MPS1. We describe cytofluorometric and time-lapse videomicroscopy methods to detect cell cycle progression, including the assessment of cell cycle distribution, quantification of mitotic cell fraction, and analysis of single cell fate profile of living cells. We applied these methods to validate the synchronization-desynchronization protocol and to qualitatively and quantitatively determine the impact of SAC inactivation on the activity of antimitotic agents.|Non-Cancer
ID:27821113|Title:Case report of whole genome sequencing in the XY female: identification of a novel SRY mutation and revision of a misdiagnosis of androgen insensitivity syndrome.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The 46,XY female is characterised by a male karyotype and female phenotype arising due to any interruption in the sexual development pathways in utero. The cause is usually genetic and various genes are implicated. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we describe a 46,XY woman who was first diagnosed with androgen insensitivity syndrome (testicular feminisation) at 18 years; however, this was later questioned due to the presence of intact Mullerian structures. The clinical phenotype suggested several susceptibility genes including SRY, DHH, NR5A1, NR0B1, AR, AMH, and AMHR2. To study candidate genes simultaneously, we performed whole genome sequencing. This revealed a novel and likely pathogenic missense variant (p.Arg130Pro, c.389G>C) in SRY, one of the major genes implicated in complete gonadal dysgenesis, hence securing this condition over androgen insensitivity syndrome as the cause of the patient's disorder of sexual development. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the emerging clinical utility of whole genome sequencing as a tool in differentiating disorders of sexual development.|Non-Cancer
ID:27826699|Title:A unique case of multiple non-ossifying fibromas with polyostotic monomelic distribution and aggressive clinical course.Abstract:Multiple non-ossifying fibromas (MNOFs) occur either isolated or in association with other anomalies, are usually localized in the long bones of the lower limbs, may be radiographically confused with other skeletal lesions, and tend to heal spontaneously with the completion of the skeletal growth. Segmental distribution, either monomelic or polymelic and ipsilateral, is rare and commonly observed in the context of developmental diseases known as "RASopathies", which are caused by mutations in genes that encode components or regulators within the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. We describe here the radiographic and pathologic features of an 18-year-old Caucasian boy, whose clinical history started at the age of 3 when the diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst was made on a lytic lesion of his left clavicle. Over the following 2 years, the patient developed polyostotic and monomelic lesions within the left humerus, radius, and ulna. No other skeletal and extra-skeletal anomalies were clinically detected. The lesions were interpreted as consistent with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and MNOFs and showed an unusually aggressive clinical course with progressive increase in size and coalescence. The definitive diagnosis of MNOFs was made after the exclusion of fibrous dysplasia by molecular analysis. The polyostotic and monomelic distribution of the lesions and the unusually aggressive clinical course contribute to make this case of MNOFs unique.|Non-Cancer
ID:27830539|Title:Primary autoimmune myelofibrosis: a case report and review of the literature.Abstract:Autoimmune myelofibrosis is a rare, distinct clinicopathological entity that can occur in isolation (primary) or in association with systemic autoimmune disorders (secondary), such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome. This disease is characterized by isolated or combined chronic cytopenias associated with autoimmune phenomena and bone-marrow fibrosis. Due to the rarity of this disease, patients are frequently misdiagnosed as having primary myelofibrosis, the most common form of bone-marrow fibrosis. Distinguishing between both disease entities is essential given the drastic therapeutic and prognostic differences between both disorders. We report a case of primary autoimmune myelofibrosis presenting with severe isolated anemia refractory to multiple lines of therapy. This patient was initially misdiagnosed as primary myelofibrosis. The absence of the characteristic features of primary myelofibrosis and the lack of a clonal abnormality on cytogenetic and molecular studies, particularly JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutation analyses, confirmed the absence of an aberrant neoplastic process. Furthermore, the presence of monoclonal T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangements delineated the presence of an autoimmune disorder supporting our diagnosis of primary autoimmune myelofibrosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:27831994|Title:Pseudarthrosis Repair Using Autologous Cultured Osteoblasts in Complex Type-1 Neurofibromatosis Spinal Deformity: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.Abstract:STUDY DESIGN: A case report and literature review. OBJECTIVE: To report a late dislocation of the vertebra caused by progressive dural ectasia combined with type-1 neurofibromatosis (NF-1) and the clinical results of pseudarthrosis repairs using autologous cultured osteoblasts. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: NF-1 is a well-known genetic disorder that is commonly characterized by spinal deformities including kyphoscoliosis. Late dislocation of the vertebra resulting from progressive dural ectasia after surgical correction of NF-1 scoliosis is a very rare occurrence, and pseudarthrosis frequently develops after surgical intervention for this complex spinal deformity. METHODS: A 32-year-old female patient with NF-1 scoliosis underwent surgical correction with posterior instrumented fusion. Seventeen years later, dislocation of the lumbar spine with implant failure resulting from massive progressive dural ectasia was observed. She underwent anterior interbody fusion three times and posterior instrumented fusion four times for pseudarthrosis followed by surgical deformity correction. For the last operation, autologous cultured osteoblasts were used as a therapeutic approach to repair the pseudarthrosis, and a three-dimensional printing technique was used to understand the surgical anatomy of the dislocated lumbar spine in detail. RESULTS: After the final operation, bone union was achieved and confirmed by clinical and radiological examination. CONCLUSION: Spine surgeons should be knowledgeable about the possibility of late destabilization of the spine, due to pulsatile dural ectasia, and a high rate of pseudarthrosis in neurofibromatosis. Autologous cultured osteoblasts may prove to be a modality that can be applied pseudarthrosis repair to treat complex spinal deformity. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.|Non-Cancer
ID:27855285|Title:Computational drug treatment simulations on projections of dysregulated protein networks derived from the myelodysplastic mutanome match clinical response in patients.Abstract:Although the majority of MDS patients fail to achieve clinical improvement to approved therapies, some patients benefit from treatment. Predicting patient response prior to therapy would improve treatment effectiveness, avoid treatment-related adverse events and reduce healthcare costs. Three separate cohorts of MDS patients were used to simulate drug response to lenalidomide alone, hypomethylating agent (HMA) alone, or HMA plus lenalidomide. Utilizing a computational biology program, genomic abnormalities in each patient were used to create an intracellular pathway map that was then used to screen for drug response. In the lenalidomide treated cohort, computer modeling correctly matched clinical responses in 37/46 patients (80%). In the second cohort, 15 HMA patients were modeled and correctly matched to responses in 12 (80%). In the third cohort, computer modeling correctly matched responses in 10/10 patients (100%). This computational biology network approach identified GGH overexpression as a potential resistance factor to HMA treatment and paradoxical activation of beta-catenin (through Csnk1a1 inhibition) as a resistance factor to lenalidomide treatment. We demonstrate that a computational technology is able to map the complexity of the MDS mutanome to simulate and predict drug response. This tool can improve understanding of MDS biology and mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance.|Non-Cancer
ID:27859271|Title:Genetics meets pathology - an increasingly important relationship.Abstract:The analytical power of modern methods for DNA analysis has outstripped our capability to interpret and understand the data generated. To make good use of this genomic data in a biomedical setting (whether for research or diagnosis), it is vital that we understand the mechanisms through which mutations affect biochemical pathways and physiological systems. This lies at the centre of what genetics is all about, and it is the reason why genetics and genomics should go hand in hand whenever possible. In this Annual Review Issue of The Journal of Pathology, we have assembled a collection of 16 expert reviews covering a wide range of topics. Through these, we illustrate the power of genetic analysis to improve our understanding of normal physiology and disease pathology, and thereby to think in rational ways about clinical management.

ID:27885891|Title:Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome in a child presenting with macrothrombocytopenia.Abstract:Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare X-linked recessive disease resulting from variants in the WAS gene, characterized by a triad of immunodeficiency, eczema, and thrombocytopenia. Despite the fact that WAS is traditionally differentiated from immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) by small size of WAS platelets, in practice, microthrombocytopenia may occasionally not be present, and in certain cases, WAS patients exhibit some parallelism to ITP patients. We characterized one patient presenting with the classic form of the disease but increased mean platelet volume. Molecular studies revealed a novel hemizygous 1-bp deletion in WAS gene, c.802delC, leading to a frameshift and stop codon at amino acid 308 (p.Arg268Glyfs*40). Next-generation sequencing of a total of 70 additional genes known to harbor variants implicated in inherited platelet disorders did not identify additional defects. The pathogenesis of macrothrombocytopenia in this case is not known, but probably the coexistence of a still unidentified additional genetic variant might be involved.|Non-Cancer
ID:27935710|Title:Quantification of ATP7B Protein in Dried Blood Spots by Peptide Immuno-SRM as a Potential Screen for Wilson's Disease.Abstract:Wilson's Disease (WD), a copper transport disorder caused by a genetic defect in the ATP7B gene, has been a long time strong candidate for newborn screening (NBS), since early interventions can give better results by preventing irreversible neurological disability or liver cirrhosis. Several previous pilot studies measuring ceruloplasmin (CP) in infants or children showed that this marker alone was insufficient to meet the universal screening for WD. WD results from mutations that cause absent or markedly diminished levels of ATP7B. Therefore, ATP7B could serve as a marker for the screening of WD, if the protein can be detected from dried blood spots (DBS). This study demonstrates that the immuno-SRM platform can quantify ATP7B in DBS in the picomolar range, and that the assay readily distinguishes affected cases from normal controls (p < 0.0001). The assay precision was <10% CV, and the protein was stable for a week in DBS at room temperature. These promising proof-of-concept data open up the possibility of screening WD in newborns and the potential for a multiplexed assay for screening a variety of congenital disorders using proteins as biomarkers in DBS.|Non-Cancer
ID:27939943|Title:The Mitotic Checkpoint Complex Requires an Evolutionary Conserved Cassette to Bind and Inhibit Active APC/C.Abstract:The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) ensures genomic stability by preventing sister chromatid separation until all chromosomes are attached to the spindle. It catalyzes the production of the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC), which inhibits Cdc20 to inactivate the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). Here we show that two Cdc20-binding motifs in BubR1 of the recently identified ABBA motif class are crucial for the MCC to recognize active APC/C-Cdc20. Mutating these motifs eliminates MCC binding to the APC/C, thereby abolishing the SAC and preventing cells from arresting in response to microtubule poisons. These ABBA motifs flank a KEN box to form a cassette that is highly conserved through evolution, both in the arrangement and spacing of the ABBA-KEN-ABBA motifs, and association with the amino-terminal KEN box required to form the MCC. We propose that the ABBA-KEN-ABBA cassette holds the MCC onto the APC/C by binding the two Cdc20 molecules in the MCC-APC/C complex.|Non-Cancer
ID:28019712|Title:Inferior vena cava filters.Abstract:Use of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters has increased dramatically in recent decades, despite a lack of evidence that their use has impacted venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related mortality. This increased use appears to be primarily driven by the insertion of retrievable filters for prophylactic indications. A growing body of evidence, however, suggests that IVC filters are frequently associated with clinically important adverse events, prompting a closer look at their role. We sought to narratively review the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of IVC filter placements. Inferior vena cava filters remain the only treatment option for patients with an acute (within 2-4 weeks) proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism and an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation. In such patients, anticoagulation should be resumed and IVC filters removed as soon as the contraindication has passed. For all other indications, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of IVC filters and high-quality trials are required. In patients where an IVC filter remains, regular follow-up to reassess removal and screen for filter-related complications should occur.|Non-Cancer
ID:28120103|Title:Mutations in chromatin regulators functionally link Cornelia de Lange syndrome and clinically overlapping phenotypes.Abstract:The coordinated tissue-specific regulation of gene expression is essential for the proper development of all organisms. Mutations in multiple transcriptional regulators cause a group of neurodevelopmental disorders termed "transcriptomopathies" that share core phenotypical features including growth retardation, developmental delay, intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism. Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) belongs to this class of disorders and is caused by mutations in different subunits or regulators of the cohesin complex. Herein, we report on the clinical and molecular characterization of seven patients with features overlapping with CdLS who were found to carry mutations in chromatin regulators previously associated to other neurodevelopmental disorders that are frequently considered in the differential diagnosis of CdLS. The identified mutations affect the methyltransferase-encoding genes KMT2A and SETD5 and different subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. Complementary to this, a patient with Coffin-Siris syndrome was found to carry a missense substitution in NIPBL. Our findings indicate that mutations in a variety of chromatin-associated factors result in overlapping clinical phenotypes, underscoring the genetic heterogeneity that should be considered when assessing the clinical and molecular diagnosis of neurodevelopmental syndromes. It is clear that emerging molecular mechanisms of chromatin dysregulation are central to understanding the pathogenesis of these clinically overlapping genetic disorders.|Non-Cancer
ID:28146470|Title:Rare and low-frequency coding variants alter human adult height.Abstract:Height is a highly heritable, classic polygenic trait with approximately 700 common associated variants identified through genome-wide association studies so far. Here, we report 83 height-associated coding variants with lower minor-allele frequencies (in the range of 0.1-4.8%) and effects of up to 2 centimetres per allele (such as those in IHH, STC2, AR and CRISPLD2), greater than ten times the average effect of common variants. In functional follow-up studies, rare height-increasing alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1-2 centimetres per allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and increased cleavage of IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors. These 83 height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological candidates (such as ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such as proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in growth. Our results demonstrate that sufficiently large sample sizes can uncover rare and low-frequency variants of moderate-to-large effect associated with polygenic human phenotypes, and that these variants implicate relevant genes and pathways.|Non-Cancer
ID:28163183|Title:A Femoral Common Vein Aneurysm in a Patient with Neurofibromatosis Syndrome Type 1.Abstract:Neurofibromatosis type I (NFI), also called Von Recklinghausen disease, is an autosomal dominant disease secondary to a genetic mutation on the long arm of chromosome 17. This disorder affects neural crest cells. Cutaneous clinical forms are the most frequent with multiple benign skin neurofibromas, associated with cafe au lait skin spots and iris hamartomas. Vascular abnormalities in NF1 are rare but have also been well described. The most frequent abnormalities are characterized by arterial aneurysm degeneration, stenosis, and malformations. Venous locations are rare, but some cases of venous aneurysms were described with ruptures as complications. We present a rare case of thrombosed venous femoral aneurysm associated with a pulmonary embolism in a patient affected by NF1.|Non-Cancer
ID:28165011|Title:mTORC1-independent TFEB activation via Akt inhibition promotes cellular clearance in neurodegenerative storage diseases.Abstract:Neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aberrant accumulation of undigested cellular components represent unmet medical conditions for which the identification of actionable targets is urgently needed. Here we identify a pharmacologically actionable pathway that controls cellular clearance via Akt modulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal pathways. We show that Akt phosphorylates TFEB at Ser467 and represses TFEB nuclear translocation independently of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a known TFEB inhibitor. The autophagy enhancer trehalose activates TFEB by diminishing Akt activity. Administration of trehalose to a mouse model of Batten disease, a prototypical neurodegenerative disease presenting with intralysosomal storage, enhances clearance of proteolipid aggregates, reduces neuropathology and prolongs survival of diseased mice. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt promotes cellular clearance in cells from patients with a variety of lysosomal diseases, thus suggesting broad applicability of this approach. These findings open new perspectives for the clinical translation of TFEB-mediated enhancement of cellular clearance in neurodegenerative storage diseases.|Non-Cancer
ID:28291640|Title:Pegylated interferon alfa-2a in patients with essential thrombocythaemia or polycythaemia vera: a post-hoc, median 83 month follow-up of an open-label, phase 2 trial.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Pegylated interferon alfa-2a is an immunomodulatory agent used to treat polycythemia vera. The durability of responses and long-term safety of this drug in patients with polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia have not been reported. Here, we present long-term efficacy and safety data from a single-centre, open-label, phase 2 trial, after a median of 83 months follow up. METHODS: Patients older than 18 years who were diagnosed with essential thrombocythaemia or polycythaemia vera according to 2001 WHO criteria were eligible to enrol in our study. The initial starting dose of pegylated interferon alfa-2a was 450 mug subcutaneously once per week, but was decreased in a stepwise manner due to toxic effects to a final starting dose of 90 mg per week: three patients were started at a dose of 450 mg per week, three at 360 mg per week, 19 at 270 mg per week, 26 at 180 mg per week, and 32 at 90 mg per week. Treatment was continued for as long as the patients derived clinical benefit with reductions in dose and frequency of administration allowed at the discretion of the treating physician. Haematological responses were assessed every 3-6 months on the basis of blood counts as defined by the European LeukemiaNet critieria. The primary endpoint of the initial study was the proportion of patients with a haematological response. Complete haematological response was defined as normalisation of blood counts (for patients with essential thrombocythaemia, platelets <=440 x 109 per L; for patients with polycythaemia vera, haemoglobin <15 0 g/L without phlebotomy) with complete resolution of palpable splenomegaly or symptoms in the absence of a thrombotic event. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics and in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00452023 and is ongoing but not enrolling new patients. FINDINGS: Between May 21, 2005, and Dec 1, 2015, patients were followed up for a median of 83 months (IQR 69-94 months). Pegylated interferon alfa-2a induced haematological (66 [80%] of 83 patients) and molecular responses (35 [63%] of 55 patients) in 40 patients with essential thrombocythaemia and 43 patients with polycythaemia vera, with median durations of 66 months (IQR 35-83) and 53 months (24-70), respectively. 26 (39%) of 66 haematological responders and 25 (71%) of 35 molecular responders (with the JAK2 Val617Phe mutation) have maintained some response during follow-up: 49% maintained their best molecular response (nine of ten patients who had a complete response, five of 20 who had a partial response, and three of five who had a minor response). The incidence of major venous-thrombotic events during the study was 1 22 per 100 person-years. Overall, 18 (22%) of 83 patients discontinued therapy due to treatment-related toxicity. Although toxicity rates decreased over time, five patients had treatment-limiting grade 3 or 4 toxicities after 60 months on therapy. 32 patients are still enrolled on the study. INTERPRETATION: Pegylated interferon alfa-2a can induce durable haematological and molecular responses in patients with essential thrombocythaemia and polycythaemia vera. This drug alone and in combination with other drugs could be explored further in clinical trials. FUNDING: US National Cancer Institute.|Non-Cancer
ID:28295149|Title:Enlarged posterior fossa on prenatal imaging: differential diagnosis, associated anomalies and postnatal outcome.Abstract:INTRODUCTION: The primary aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of the individual conditions and of associated anomalies in fetuses with the prenatal diagnosis of enlarged posterior fossa (PF) and to explore the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in these anomalies. The secondary aim was to evaluate the postnatal outcome of children affected by PF anomalies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All fetuses with enlarged PF detected by prenatal sonography at a referral center from 2001 to 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. Some were also studied by fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or volume ultrasound examinations. Fetal sonographic and MRI were compared using following classification: Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM); megacisterna magna (MCM); Blake's pouch cyst; isolated vermian hypoplasia; vermian agenesis; PF arachnoid cyst (AC); and cerebellar hypoplasia (CH). RESULTS: The ultrasound diagnoses of the 69 fetuses were as follows: MCM (n = 29; of these isolated n = 15), DWM (n = 28, isolated n = 4), vermian hypoplasia (n = 5, isolated n = 4), Blake's pouch cyst (n = 4, isolated n = 1), CH (n = 2; none isolated) and AC in the PF (n = 1, isolated). Thirteen of the 41 karyotyped fetuses were aneuploid, including seven with DWM. Associated malformations were found in 37/69 cases. There were 39 live births, including 11 with confirmed DWM, six of whom show a normal development. Twelve infants with isolated MCM show normal development. There were eight false-positive prenatal diagnoses (or resolution until birth) of "enlarged PF": three with Blake's pouch cyst, two with MCM and one with vermian hypoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: An enlarged PF requires specific diagnoses for the best possible counseling. The term "Dandy-Walker variant" should not be used anymore. Isolated MCM and Blake's pouch cyst can either resolve or be normal variants, but may also indicate the presence of a more severe anomaly or associated malformations.|Non-Cancer
ID:28298420|Title:Staged induction of HIV-1 glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies.Abstract:A preventive HIV-1 vaccine should induce HIV-1-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). However, bnAbs generally require high levels of somatic hypermutation (SHM) to acquire breadth, and current vaccine strategies have not been successful in inducing bnAbs. Because bnAbs directed against a glycosylated site adjacent to the third variable loop (V3) of the HIV-1 envelope protein require limited SHM, the V3-glycan epitope is an attractive vaccine target. By studying the cooperation among multiple V3-glycan B cell lineages and their coevolution with autologous virus throughout 5 years of infection, we identify key events in the ontogeny of a V3-glycan bnAb. Two autologous neutralizing antibody lineages selected for virus escape mutations and consequently allowed initiation and affinity maturation of a V3-glycan bnAb lineage. The nucleotide substitution required to initiate the bnAb lineage occurred at a low-probability site for activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity. Cooperation of B cell lineages and an improbable mutation critical for bnAb activity defined the necessary events leading to breadth in this V3-glycan bnAb lineage. These findings may, in part, explain why initiation of V3-glycan bnAbs is rare, and suggest an immunization strategy for inducing similar V3-glycan bnAbs.|Non-Cancer
ID:28347285|Title:Whole-exome sequencing and digital PCR identified a novel compound heterozygous mutation in the NPHP1 gene in a case of Joubert syndrome and related disorders.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition with autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance, which share a distinctive neuroradiological hallmark, the so-called molar tooth sign. JSRD is classified into six clinical subtypes based on associated variable multiorgan involvement. To date, 21 causative genes have been identified in JSRD, which makes genetic diagnosis difficult. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here a case of a 28-year-old Japanese woman diagnosed with JS with oculorenal defects with a novel compound heterozygous mutation (p.Ser219*/deletion) in the NPHP1 gene. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of the patient identified the novel nonsense mutation in an apparently homozygous state. However, it was absent in her mother and heterozygous in her father. A read depth-based copy number variation (CNV) detection algorithm using WES data of the family predicted a large heterozygous deletion mutation in the patient and her mother, which was validated by digital polymerase chain reaction, indicating that the patient was compound heterozygous for the paternal nonsense mutation and the maternal deletion mutation spanning the site of the single nucleotide change. CONCLUSION: It should be noted that analytical pipelines that focus purely on sequence information cannot distinguish homozygosity from hemizygosity because of its inability to detect large deletions. The ability to detect CNVs in addition to single nucleotide variants and small insertion/deletions makes WES an attractive diagnostic tool for genetically heterogeneous disorders.|Non-Cancer
ID:28378438|Title:Legius syndrome: A case report.Abstract:Legius syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by heterozygous germ line loss-of-function SPRED1 mutation. In Japan, a family with Legius syndrome was first described in 2015 by Sakai et al. We described a first solitary case of Legius syndrome identified by next-generation sequencing in Japan. A 37-year-old woman presented with multiple cafe-au-lait macules and freckles but has no other features of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). Sequencing results showed the presence of a mutation in exon 2 of SPRED1 c.70C>T, resulting in the protein at position 24 (p.Arg24X). When a dermatological clinician sees an adult patient showing only pigmented lesions and no other specifically diagnostic features of NF-1, it is important to suspect the possibility of Legius syndrome.|Non-Cancer
ID:28423318|Title:Oligodendrocyte Nf1 Controls Aberrant Notch Activation and Regulates Myelin Structure and Behavior.Abstract:The RASopathy neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common autosomal dominant genetic disorders. In NF1 patients, neurological issues may result from damaged myelin, and mice with a neurofibromin gene (Nf1) mutation show white matter (WM) defects including myelin decompaction. Using mouse genetics, we find that altered Nf1 gene-dose in mature oligodendrocytes results in progressive myelin defects and behavioral abnormalities mediated by aberrant Notch activation. Blocking Notch, upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or nitric oxide signaling rescues myelin defects in hemizygous Nf1 mutants, and pharmacological gamma secretase inhibition rescues aberrant behavior with no effects in wild-type (WT) mice. Concomitant pathway inhibition rescues myelin abnormalities in homozygous mutants. Notch activation is also observed in Nf1+/- mouse brains, and cells containing active Notch are increased in NF1 patient WM. We thus identify Notch as an Nf1 effector regulating myelin structure and behavior in a RASopathy and suggest that inhibition of Notch signaling may be a therapeutic strategy for NF1.|Non-Cancer
ID:28427233|Title:Assessment of the interlaboratory variability and robustness of JAK2V617F mutation assays: A study involving a consortium of 19 Italian laboratories.Abstract:To date, a plenty of techniques for the detection of JAK2V617F is used over different laboratories, with substantial differences in specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, to provide reliable and comparable results, the standardization of molecular techniques is mandatory.A network of 19 centers was established to 1) evaluate the inter- and intra-laboratory variability in JAK2V617F quantification, 2) identify the most robust assay for the standardization of the molecular test and 3) allow consistent interpretation of individual patient analysis results. The study was conceived in 3 different rounds, in which all centers had to blindly test DNA samples with different JAK2V617F allele burden (AB) using both quantitative and qualitative assays.The positivity of samples with an AB < 1% was not detected by qualitative assays. Conversely, laboratories performing the quantitative approach were able to determine the expected JAK2V617F AB. Quantitative results were reliable across all mutation loads with moderate variability at low AB (0.1 and 1%; CV = 0.46 and 0.77, respectively). Remarkably, all laboratories clearly distinguished between the 0.1 and 1% mutated samples.In conclusion, a qualitative approach is not sensitive enough to detect the JAK2V617F mutation, especially at low AB. On the contrary, the ipsogen JAK2 MutaQuant CE-IVD kit resulted in a high, efficient and sensitive quantification detection of all mutation loads. This study sets the basis for the standardization of molecular techniques for JAK2V617F determination, which will require the employment of approved operating procedures and the use of certificated standards, such as the recent WHO 1st International Reference Panel for Genomic JAK2V617F.|Non-Cancer
ID:28429859|Title:Aneurysms in neurofibromatosis type 2: Evidence for vasculopathy?Abstract:There have been anecdotal reports of vasculopathy associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2). Given the increasing use of bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor which results in an increased risk of bleeding, it is important to ascertain if there is a predisposition to vascular abnormalities in NF2. In our unit NF2 patients undergo annual MRI brain and internal auditory meatus imaging. We noted incidental intracranial aneurysms in some patients and sought to determine the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in our cohort of NF2 patients. We conducted a retrospective audit of the MRI images of 104 NF2 patients from 2014 to 2016. Axial T2 brain MRI images were assessed for vascular abnormalities by two neuroradiologists blinded to patient's clinical details. Intracranial aneurysms were detected in four patients and an aneurysm clip related to previous surgery was noted in one additional patient. Using standard MRI imaging sequences alone we provide evidence of intracranial aneurysms in 4.4% of our cohort. This compares with an estimated overall prevalence of 3% in the general population. We discuss these findings as well as other evidence for a vasculopathy associated with NF2.|Non-Cancer
ID:28432683|Title:Prospective evaluation of the diagnostic value of sensitive KIT D816V mutation analysis of blood in adults with suspected systemic mastocytosis.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Sensitive KIT D816V mutation analysis of blood has been proposed to guide bone marrow (BM) investigation in suspected systemic mastocytosis (SM). The aim of this prospective study was for the first time to compare the D816V status of the "screening blood sample" used to guide BM biopsy in suspected SM to the outcome of the subsequent BM investigation. METHODS: Fifty-eight adult patients with suspected SM were included. The outcome of sensitive KIT D816V analysis of blood was compared to the result of the BM investigation. RESULTS: Screening blood samples from 44 of 58 patients tested D816V-positive. In 43 of these, SM was subsequently diagnosed in the BM investigation. One patient with a D816V-positive screening sample was diagnosed with monoclonal MC activation syndrome. Screening blood samples from 14 patients tested D816V-negative. SM was subsequently diagnosed in five of these, whereas nine patients did not fulfill any diagnostic SM criteria (excluding tryptase criterion). Of the 48 SM patients, 90% tested D816V-positive. Thirteen SM patients presented with Hymenoptera venom-induced anaphylaxis, no skin lesions, and baseline serum tryptase <=20 ng/mL. Of these, 92% tested D816V-positive in the screening blood sample. CONCLUSION: This prospective study demonstrates that a D816V-positive result in a screening blood sample identifies SM among patients with hymenoptera venom-induced anaphylaxis in whom the diagnosis would most probably have been missed, with potential severe implications. The observed false-negative screening results also underline that BM investigation is mandatory in all adult patients with clear signs of, or highly suspected SM, regardless of the KIT mutation status.|Non-Cancer
ID:28475226|Title:Molecular cytogenetic characterization of five F8 complex rearrangements: utility for haemophilia A genetic counselling.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Genomic inversions are usually balanced, but unusual patterns have been described in haemophilia A (HA) patients for intron 22 (Inv22) and intron 1 (Inv1) inversions leading to the hypothesis of more complex rearrangements involving deletions or duplications. AIM: To characterize five abnormal patterns either in Southern blot and long-range PCR for Inv22 or in PCR for Inv1. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients were studied using cytogenetic microarray analysis (CMA). RESULTS: In all cases, CMA analysis found that each inversion was associated with complex Xq28 rearrangement. In three patients, CMA analysis showed large duplication ranging from 230 to 1302 kb and encompassing a various number of contiguous genes among which RAB39B. RAB39B duplication is a strong candidate gene for X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Surprisingly, none of the severe HA patients with RAB39B duplication reported in this study or in the literature exhibited XLID. We hypothesise that F8 complex rearrangement down regulated RAB39B expression. In the two remaining patients, CMA analysis found Xq28 large deletion (from 285 to 522 kb). Moyamoya syndrome was strongly suspected in one of them who carried BRCC3 deletion. CONCLUSION: Because several F8 neighbouring genes are associated with other pathologies such as XLID and cardiovascular disease, all HA patients where complex Xq28 rearrangement was suspected should be referred to a geneticist for possible utility of a pangenomic study. Such investigation should be carefully considered in genetic counselling in female carriers to assess the risk of transmitting severe HA with a "contiguous gene syndrome".|Non-Cancer
ID:28500564|Title:Calcium Signaling: From Normal B Cell Development to Tolerance Breakdown and Autoimmunity.Abstract:Maintenance of self-tolerance of auto-reactive lymphocytes is a fundamental mechanism to prevent the onset of autoimmune diseases. Deciphering the mechanisms involved in the deregulations leading to tolerance disruption and autoimmunity is still a major area of interest to identify new therapeutic targets and options. Ca2+ signaling plays a major role in B cell normal development and is therefore finely tuned by B cell receptor (BCR)-dependent and independent pathways. Developmental changes in the characteristics of BCR-dependent Ca2+ signals as well as the modulation of basal intracellular concentration ([Ca2+]i) contribute strongly to self-tolerance maintaining mechanisms responsible for the physical or functional elimination of autoreactive B cells such as clonal deletion, receptor editing, and anergy. Implication of Ca2+ signals in B tolerance mechanisms mainly occurs through the specific activation of transcriptional programs depending on the amplitude, shape, and duration of Ca2+ signals. A large number of studies reported Ca2+ signaling defects in autoimmune pathology such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS). However, the precise nature of the molecular events responsible for these deregulations is not fully understood. Moreover, the demonstration of a direct correlation between Ca2+ signaling defects and tolerance disruption is still lacking. The recent identification of proteins involved in B cell Ca2+ signals such as ORAI, stromal interaction molecule and transient receptor potential is opening new horizons for understanding Ca2+ signaling defects observed in autoimmune diseases and for proposing potentially new therapeutic solutions. This review aims to present an overview of the developmental evolution of BCR dependent Ca2+ signaling and to place this signaling pathway in the context of mechanisms involved in tolerance maintenance and breakdown.|Non-Cancer
ID:28504684|Title:Fully automated 5-plex fluorescent immunohistochemistry with tyramide signal amplification and same species antibodies.Abstract:The ability to simultaneously visualize the presence, abundance, location and functional state of many targets in cells and tissues has been described as a true next-generation approach in immunohistochemistry (IHC). A typical requirement for multiplex IHC (mIHC) is the use of different animal species for each primary (1 Ab) and secondary (2 Ab) antibody pair. Although 1 Abs from different species have been used with differently labeled species-specific 2 Abs, quite often the appropriate combination of antibodies is not available. More recently, sequential detection of multiple antigens using 1 Abs from the same species used a microwaving treatment between successive antigen detection cycles to elute previously bound 1 Ab/2 Ab complex and therefore to prevent the cross-reactivity of anti-species 2 Abs used in subsequent detection cycles. We present here a fully automated 1 Ab/2 Ab complex heat deactivation (HD) method on Ventana's BenchMark ULTRA slide stainer. This method is applied to detection using fluorophore-conjugated tyramide deposited on the tissue and takes advantage of the strong covalent bonding of the detection substrate to the tissue, preventing its elution in the HD process. The HD process was characterized for (1) effectiveness in preventing Ab cross-reactivity, (2) impact on the epitopes and (3) impact on the fluorophores. An automated 5-plex fluorescent IHC assay was further developed using the HD method and rabbit 1 Abs for CD3, CD8, CD20, CD68 and FoxP3 immune biomarkers in human tissue specimens. The fluorophores were carefully chosen and the narrow-band filters were designed to allow visualization of the staining under fluorescent microscope with minimal bleed through. The automated 5-plex fluorescent IHC assay achieved staining results comparable to the respective single-plex chromogenic IHC assays. This technology enables automated mIHC using unmodified 1 Abs from same species and the corresponding anti-species 2 Ab on a clinically established automated platform to ensure staining quality, reliability and reproducibility.|Non-Cancer
ID:28512266|Title:Activating MAPK1 (ERK2) mutation in an aggressive case of disseminated juvenile xanthogranuloma.Abstract:Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) is a rare histiocytic disorder that is usually benign and self-limiting. We present a case of atypical, aggressive JXG harboring a novel mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway mutation in the MAPK1 gene, which encodes mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 or extracellular signal-regulated 2 (ERK2). Our analysis revealed that the mutation results in constitutive ERK activation that is resistant to BRAF or MEK inhibitors but susceptible to an ERK inhibitor. These data highlight the importance of identifying specific MAPK pathway alterations as part of the diagnostic workup for patients with histiocytic disorders rather than initiating empiric treatment with MEK inhibitors.|Non-Cancer
ID:28604711|Title:The anaphase promoting complex impacts repair choice by protecting ubiquitin signalling at DNA damage sites.Abstract:Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired through two major pathways, homology-directed recombination (HDR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). While HDR can only occur in S/G2, NHEJ can happen in all cell cycle phases (except mitosis). How then is the repair choice made in S/G2 cells? Here we provide evidence demonstrating that APCCdh1 plays a critical role in choosing the repair pathways in S/G2 cells. Our results suggest that the default for all DSBs is to recruit 53BP1 and RIF1. BRCA1 is blocked from being recruited to broken ends because its recruitment signal, K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains on histones, is actively destroyed by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1. We show that the removal of USP1 depends on APCCdh1 and requires Chk1 activation known to be catalysed by ssDNA-RPA-ATR signalling at the ends designated for HDR, linking the status of end processing to RIF1 or BRCA1 recruitment.|Non-Cancer
ID:28605748|Title:Characterization of the Phenotype Associated with Microduplication Reciprocal to NF1 Microdeletion Syndrome.Abstract:17q11.2 microduplication syndrome is a recently described relatively rare condition associated with a nonspecific phenotype. Intellectual disability, developmental delay, and dysmorphisms are the only clinical features common to a majority of cases. Seventeen patients have been reported so far. Here, we present another patient with 17q11.2 duplication and no signs of neurofibromatosis type 1, identified by array-CGH. We compared clinical features and genetic data with those of previously reported patients with 17q11.2 microduplications. We also analyzed the gene content of the duplicated region in order to investigate the possible role of specific genes in the clinical phenotype of our patient.|Non-Cancer
ID:28612357|Title:Multidimensional assessment of patient condition and mutational analysis in peripheral blood, as tools to improve outcome prediction in myelodysplastic syndromes: A prospective study of the Spanish MDS group.Abstract:The International Prognostic Scoring System and its revised form (IPSS-R) are the most widely used indices for prognostic assessment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), but can only partially account for the observed variation in patient outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the relative contribution of patient condition and mutational status in peripheral blood when added to the IPSS-R, for estimating overall survival and the risk of leukemic transformation in patients with MDS. A prospective cohort (2006-2015) of 200 consecutive patients with MDS were included in the study series and categorized according to the IPSS-R. Patients were further stratified according to patient condition (assessed using the multidimensional Lee index for older adults) and genetic mutations (peripheral blood samples screened using next-generation sequencing). The change in likelihood-ratio was tested in Cox models after adding individual covariates. The addition of the Lee index to the IPSS-R significantly improved prediction of overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) 3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96-4.66, P < 0.001), and mutational analysis significantly improved prediction of leukemic evolution (HR 2.64, 1.56-4.46, P < 0.001). Non-leukemic death was strongly linked to patient condition (HR 2.71, 1.72-4.25, P < 0.001), but not to IPSS-R score (P = 0.35) or mutational status (P = 0.75). Adjustment for exposure to disease-modifying therapy, evaluated as a time-dependent covariate, had no effect on the proposed model's predictive ability. In conclusion, patient condition, assessed by the multidimensional Lee index and patient mutational status can improve the prediction of clinical outcomes of patients with MDS already stratified by IPSS-R.|Non-Cancer
ID:28630220|Title:Beyond cervical lipomas: myoclonus, gait disorder and multisystem involvement leading to mitochondrial disease.Abstract:Madelung's disease (benign symmetric lipomatosis) is a rare syndrome in which there are multiple lipomas around the neck, upper limbs and trunk in the context of chronic alcoholism. We report on a female patient with lipomas and slightly progressive myoclonus, neuropathy, myopathy, ataxia and respiratory systemic involvement (labelled in the past as Madelung's disease). Multisystem involvement and family history of lipomas led to the development of mitochondrial genetic tests, which can assess two concurrent mitochondrial mutations: the m.8344A>G mutation in MT-TK gene, related MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibre) phenotype and m.14484T>C mutation in the MT-ND6 gene responsible for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy phenotype.|Non-Cancer
ID:28654064|Title:Detection and Visualization of DNA Damage-induced Protein Complexes in Suspension Cell Cultures Using the Proximity Ligation Assay.Abstract:The DNA damage response orchestrates the repair of DNA lesions that occur spontaneously, are caused by genotoxic stress, or appear in the context of programmed DNA breaks in lymphocytes. The Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated kinase (ATM), ATM- and Rad3-Related kinase (ATR) and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent Protein Kinase (DNA-PKcs) are among the first that are activated upon induction of DNA damage, and are central regulators of a network that controls DNA repair, apoptosis and cell survival. As part of a tumor-suppressive pathway, ATM and ATR activate p53 through phosphorylation, thereby regulating the transcriptional activity of p53. DNA damage also results in the formation of so-called ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) that represent complexes of DNA damage sensor and repair proteins that accumulate at the sites of DNA damage, which are visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Co-localization of proteins in IRIFs, however, does not necessarily imply direct protein-protein interactions, as the resolution of fluorescence microscopy is limited. In situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) is a novel technique that allows the direct visualization of protein-protein interactions in cells and tissues with unprecedented specificity and sensitivity. This technique is based on the spatial proximity of specific antibodies binding to the proteins of interest. When the interrogated proteins are within ~40 nm an amplification reaction is triggered by oligonucleotides that are conjugated to the antibodies, and the amplification product is visualized by fluorescent labeling, yielding a signal that corresponds to the subcellular location of the interacting proteins. Using the established functional interaction between ATM and p53 as an example, it is demonstrated here how PLA can be used in suspension cell cultures to study the direct interactions between proteins that are integral parts of the DNA damage response.|Non-Cancer
ID:28671121|Title:Selenomethionine Attenuates the Amyloid-beta Level by Both Inhibiting Amyloid-beta Production and Modulating Autophagy in Neuron-2a/AbetaPPswe Cells.Abstract:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and progressive neurological disorder, and amyloid-beta (Abeta) has been recognized as the major cause of AD. Inhibiting Abeta production and/or enhancing the clearance of Abeta to reduce its levels are still the effective therapeutic strategies pursued in anti-AD research. In previous studies, we have reported that selenomethionine (Se-Met), a major form of selenium in animals and humans with significant antioxidant capacity, can reduce both amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation in a triple transgenic mouse model of AD. In this study, a Se-Met treatment significantly decreased the Abeta levels in Neuron-2a/AbetaPPswe (N2asw) cells, and the anti-amyloid effect of Se-Met was attributed to its ability to inhibit Abeta generation by suppressing the activity of BACE1. Furthermore, both the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and the number of LC3-positive puncta were significantly decreased in Se-Met-treated cells, suggesting that Se-Met also promoted Abeta clearance by modulating the autophagy pathway. Subsequently, Se-Met inhibited the initiation of autophagy through the AKT-mTOR-p70S6K signaling pathway and enhanced autophagic turnover by promoting autophagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagic clearance. Our results further highlight the potential therapeutic effects of Se-Met on AD.|Non-Cancer
ID:28679735|Title:Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 29 patients hemizygous for hypomorphic IKBKG/NEMO mutations.Abstract:X-linked recessive ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency is a rare primary immunodeficiency caused by hypomorphic mutations of the IKBKG gene encoding the nuclear factor kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) protein. This condition displays enormous allelic, immunological, and clinical heterogeneity, and therapeutic decisions are difficult because NEMO operates in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is potentially life-saving, but the small number of case reports available suggests it has been reserved for only the most severe cases. Here, we report the health status before HSCT, transplantation outcome, and clinical follow-up for a series of 29 patients from unrelated kindreds from 11 countries. Between them, these patients carry 23 different hypomorphic IKBKG mutations. HSCT was performed from HLA-identical related donors (n = 7), HLA-matched unrelated donors (n = 12), HLA-mismatched unrelated donors (n = 8), and HLA-haploidentical related donors (n = 2). Engraftment was documented in 24 patients, and graft-versus-host disease in 13 patients. Up to 7 patients died 0.2 to 12 months after HSCT. The global survival rate after HSCT among NEMO-deficient children was 74% at a median follow-up after HSCT of 57 months (range, 4-108 months). Preexisting mycobacterial infection and colitis were associated with poor HSCT outcome. The underlying mutation does not appear to have any influence, as patients with the same mutation had different outcomes. Transplantation did not appear to cure colitis, possibly as a result of cell-intrinsic disorders of the epithelial barrier. Overall, HSCT can cure most clinical features of patients with a variety of IKBKG mutations.|Non-Cancer

ID:28699658|Title:Telomere length and somatic mutations in correlation with response to immunosuppressive treatment in aplastic anaemia.Abstract:We investigated the frequencies of cytogenetic aberrations and somatic mutations of prognostic relevance in 393 patients with aplastic anaemia (AA). Clonality was determined by G-banding/fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (n = 245), and targeted capture sequencing was performed for 88 haematopoiesis-related genes (n = 70). The telomere length (TL) of bone marrow nucleated cells was measured at the single cell level by FISH (n = 135). Eighteen (4 6%) patients showed disease progression, and monosomy 7 (50 0%) was the most predominant cytogenetic evolution at disease transformation. One third of patients (32 9%) presented at least 1 mutation; the most frequently mutated genes were NOTCH1, NF1, SCRIB, BCOR and DNMT3A. The patient group with clonal changes (30 7%) showed an adverse response to immunosuppressive treatment (IST), compared to the non-clonal group, but this finding did not show statistical significance. The TL of AA patients was significantly shorter than normal control and patients with clonal changes showed significantly shorter TLs. Patients with TL>5 9 showed a higher response rate to IST (P = 0 048). In conclusion, the patients with clonal changes or TL attrition showed a poor response to IST. Shorter TL can be used not only as a biomarker, but also as a predictive marker for treatment response to IST.|Non-Cancer
ID:28700486|Title:Progression of primary myelofibrosis to polycythemia vera: A case report.Abstract:RATIONALE: This case report describes the progression of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) to polycythemia vera (PV), and discuss its potential mechanisms. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was admitted because of abdominal discomfort and enlarged spleen for 19 months. DIAGNOSIS: A case of PMF progressed to PV was retrospectively analyzed. There were 19 months between the diagnosis of PMF and PV. The JAK2 V617F mutation was positive before and after the diagnosis of PV; however, new chromosomal abnormalities were detected during the progression. INTERVENTIONS: For treatment of PMF, the danazol, calcitriol, and thalidomide were given. Then, the use of thalidomide and calcitriol was stopped, and hydroxyurea was started. For treatment of PV, interferon treatment was given, whereas hydroxyurea was continued. OUTCOMES: After 30 months of the progression (at the recent follow-up), this patient had no obvious symptoms or thrombosis. LESSONS: PMF rarely progresses to PV, however, the progression will significantly improve the quality of life and prognosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:28736931|Title:Genetic Variants in HSD17B3, SMAD3, and IPO11 Impact Circulating Lipids in Response to Fenofibrate in Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes.Abstract:Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and dyslipidemia are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Fibrates are a class of drugs prescribed to treat dyslipidemia, but variation in response has been observed. To evaluate common and rare genetic variants that impact lipid responses to fenofibrate in statin-treated patients with T2D, we examined lipid changes in response to fenofibrate therapy using a genomewide association study (GWAS). Associations were followed-up using gene expression studies in mice. Common variants in SMAD3 and IPO11 were marginally associated with lipid changes in black subjects (P < 5 x 10-6 ). Rare variant and gene expression changes were assessed using a false discovery rate approach. AKR7A3 and HSD17B13 were associated with lipid changes in white subjects (q < 0.2). Mice fed fenofibrate displayed reductions in Hsd17b13 gene expression (q < 0.1). Associations of variants in SMAD3, IPO11, and HSD17B13, with gene expression changes in mice indicate that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and NRF2 signaling pathways may influence fenofibrate effects on dyslipidemia in patients with T2D.|Non-Cancer
ID:28784848|Title:Cutting Edge: IL-2-Induced Expression of the Amino Acid Transporters SLC1A5 and CD98 Is a Prerequisite for NKG2D-Mediated Activation of Human NK Cells.Abstract:Priming of human NK cells with IL-2 is necessary to render them functionally competent upon NKG2D engagement. We examined the underlying mechanisms that control NKG2D responsiveness in NK cells and found that IL-2 upregulates expression of the amino acid transporters SLC1A5 and CD98. Using specific inhibitors to block SLC1A5 and CD98 function, we found that production of IFN-gamma and degranulation by CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells following NKG2D stimulation were dependent on both transporters. IL-2 priming increased the activity of mTORC1, and inhibition of mTORC1 abrogated the ability of the IL-2-primed NK cells to produce IFN-gamma in response to NKG2D-mediated stimulation. This study identifies a series of IL-2-induced cellular changes that regulates the NKG2D responsiveness in human NK cells.|Non-Cancer
ID:28801073|Title:Newborn screening for carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency using (C16+C18:1)/C2: Evaluation of additional indices for adequate sensitivity and lower false-positivity.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) II deficiency is one of the most common forms of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorder (FAOD). However, newborn screening (NBS) for this potentially fatal disease has not been established partly because reliable indices are not available. METHODS: We diagnosed CPT II deficiency in a 7-month-old boy presenting with hypoglycemic encephalopathy, which apparently had been missed in the NBS using C16 and C18:1 concentrations as indices. By referring to his acylcarnitine profile from the NBS, we adopted the (C16+C18:1)/C2 ratio (cutoff 0.62) and C16 concentration (cutoff 3.0nmol/mL) as alternative indices for CPT II deficiency such that an analysis of a dried blood specimen collected at postnatal day five retroactively yielded the correct diagnosis. Thereafter, positive cases were assessed by measuring (1) the fatty acid oxidation ability of intact lymphocytes and/or (2) CPT II activity in the lysates of lymphocytes. The diagnoses were then further confirmed by genetic analysis. RESULTS: The disease was diagnosed in seven of 21 newborns suspected of having CPT II deficiency based on NBS. We also analyzed the false-negative patient and five symptomatic patients for comparison. Values for the NBS indices of the false-negative, symptomatic patient were lower than those of the seven affected newborns. Although it was difficult to differentiate the false-negative patient from heterozygous carriers and false-positive subjects, the fatty acid oxidation ability of the lymphocytes and CPT II activity clearly confirmed the diagnosis. Among several other indices proposed previously, C14/C3 completely differentiated the seven NBS-positive patients and the false-negative patient from the heterozygous carriers and the false-positive subjects. Genetic analysis revealed 16 kinds of variant alleles. The most prevalent, detected in ten alleles in nine patients from eight families, was c.1148T>A (p.F383Y), a finding in line with those of several previous reports on Japanese patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that CPT II deficiency can be screened by using (C16+C18:1)/C2 and C16 as indices. An appropriate cutoff level is required to achieve adequate sensitivity albeit at the cost of a considerable increase in the false-positive rate, which might be reduced by using additional indices such as C14/C3.|Non-Cancer
ID:28813671|Title:OCT4 and SOX2 Work as Transcriptional Activators in Reprogramming Human Fibroblasts.Abstract:SOX2 and OCT4, in conjunction with KLF4 and cMYC, are sufficient to reprogram human fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), but it is unclear if they function as transcriptional activators or as repressors. We now show that, like OCT4, SOX2 functions as a transcriptional activator. We substituted SOX2-VP16 (a strong activator) for wild-type (WT) SOX2, and we saw an increase in the efficiency and rate of reprogramming, whereas the SOX2-HP1 fusion (a strong repressor) eliminated reprogramming. We report that, at an early stage of reprogramming, virtually all DNA-bound OCT4, SOX2, and SOX2-VP16 were embedded in putative enhancers, about half of which were created de novo. Those associated with SOX2-VP16 were, on average, stronger than those bearing WT SOX2. Many newly created putative enhancers were transient, and many transcription factor locations on DNA changed as reprogramming progressed. These results are consistent with the idea that, during reprogramming, there is an intermediate state that is distinct from both parental cells and iPSCs.|Non-Cancer
ID:28845713|Title:Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists for children with immune thrombocytopenia: a systematic review.Abstract:OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review to assess the efficacy and safety of Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPOras) for pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library from their earliest records to January 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Primary outcomes were durable response and clinically significant bleeding. Secondary outcomes were overall response, overall bleeding events, the use of rescue medication and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Five randomized RCTs (261participants) were included. Compared with placebo group, the proportion of patients achieving durable platelet response was significantly higher in Eltrombopag (P = 0.0004) or Romiplostim (P = 0.002) group, so was the overall response in Eltrombopag [RR = 2.64, 95% CI (1.58, 4.44)] or Romiplostim [RR = 5.05, 95% CI (2.21, 11.53)] group. Both clinically significant bleeding (P = 0.04) and total bleeding (P = 0.01) in Eltrombopag group were significantly less frequent than those in placebo group, while no significant difference between Romiplostim and placebo group. The proportion of patients receiving rescue medication, the incidence of overall AEs and serious AEs between TPO-receptor agonists and placebo group were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: TPOras might improve both durable and overall platelet response in pediatric ITP, compared with placebo.|Non-Cancer
ID:28880435|Title:Thrombocytopenia and CD34 expression is decoupled from alpha-granule deficiency with mutation of the first growth factor-independent 1B zinc finger.Abstract:Essentials The phenotypes of different growth factor-independent 1B (GFI1B) variants are not established. GFI1B variants produce heterogeneous clinical phenotypes dependent on the site of mutation. Mutation of the first non-DNA-binding zinc-finger causes a mild platelet and clinical phenotype. GFI1B regulates the CD34 promoter; platelet CD34 expression is an indicator of GFI1B mutation. SUMMARY: Background Mutation of the growth factor-independent 1B (GFI1B) fifth DNA-binding zinc-finger domain causes macrothrombocytopenia and alpha-granule deficiency leading to clinical bleeding. The phenotypes associated with GFI1B variants disrupting non-DNA-binding zinc-fingers remain uncharacterized. Objectives To determine the functional and phenotypic consequences of GFI1B variants disrupting non-DNA-binding zinc-finger domains. Methods The GFI1B C168F variant and a novel GFI1B c.2520 + 1_2520 + 8delGTGGGCAC splice variant were identified in four unrelated families. Phenotypic features, DNA-binding properties and transcriptional effects were determined and compared with those in individuals with a GFI1B H294 fs mutation of the fifth DNA-binding zinc-finger. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived megakaryocytes were generated to facilitate disease modeling. Results The DNA-binding GFI1B variant C168F, which is predicted to disrupt the first non-DNA-binding zinc-finger domain, is associated with macrothrombocytopenia without alpha-granule deficiency or bleeding symptoms. A GFI1B splice variant, c.2520 + 1_2520 + 8delGTGGGCAC, which generates a short GFI1B isoform that lacks non-DNA-binding zinc-fingers 1 and 2, is associated with increased platelet CD34 expression only, without quantitative or morphologic platelet abnormalities. GFI1B represses the CD34 promoter, and this repression is attenuated by different GFI1B zinc-finger mutations, suggesting that deregulation of CD34 expression occurs at a direct transcriptional level. Patient-specific iPSC-derived megakaryocytes phenocopy these observations. Conclusions Disruption of GFI1B non-DNA-binding zinc-finger 1 is associated with mild to moderate thrombocytopenia without alpha-granule deficiency or bleeding symptomatology, indicating that the site of GFI1B mutation has important phenotypic implications. Platelet CD34 expression appears to be a common feature of perturbed GFI1B function, and may have diagnostic utility.|Non-Cancer
ID:28919366|Title:Prevalence and risk factors for fragility fracture in systemic mastocytosis.Abstract:OBJECTIVES: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is characterized by the accumulation of mast cells in tissues other than the skin. Bone involvement although frequent has not been thoroughly evaluated. Primary objective was to determine risk factors associated with fragility fractures (FF) in SM. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the ability of bone marrow tryptase (BMT) level to identify patients with FF, and to describe bone involvement in SM. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively all consecutive patients seen in our expert center, with a diagnosis of SM according to the 2001 WHO criteria, and with complete bone assessment. We collected data about lifetime fractures, types of cutaneous manifestations, degranulation symptoms, blood and BMT levels, bone mineral density assessed by densitometry and KIT mutation. We performed a univariate analysis investigating the factors associated with FF and then a logistic multivariable regression analysis. We assessed the ability of bone marrow tryptase to identify patients with FF. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients with SM were included. Thirty-six patients (40.4%) suffered from osteoporosis and twenty-five (28.1%) experienced lifetime FF. Univariate analysis identified age at diagnosis and disease onset, presence of telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans, digestive symptoms, mast cells activation symptoms, elevated BMT, low femoral and lumbar BMD, as associated with FF. Multivariate analysis identified elevated BMT, low femoral T score and older age at diagnosis as independently associated with FF. CONCLUSIONS: Low femoral T-score, BMT level, and older age at diagnosis are markers associated with FF in SM. BMT may represent an important biomarker to predict FF in SM patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:28942514|Title:Intrauterine hyperglycemia-induced inflammatory signalling via the receptor for advanced glycation end products in the cardiac muscle of the infants of diabetic mother rats.Abstract:PURPOSE: Gestational diabetes is associated with increased risk to the health of the mother and her offspring. In particular, the infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) exhibit elevated levels of preterm birth, macrosomia, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and cardiomyopathy. We have previously reported that IDMs showed abnormalities in cardiac Akt-related insulin signalling, and that these deficiencies in Akt-related signalling were attenuated by supplementing the maternal diet with fish-oil. Herein, we investigated whether the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) found in fish oil can be used to attenuate diabetes associated impairments in cardiomyocyte signalling. METHODS: Pregnant diabetic rats were administered streptozotocin before receiving EPA or water, and their infants were designated IDM/EPA, IDM/W. We assessed the potential molecular pathway for this effect in the primary cardiac cell from newborn rat hearts. RESULTS: Insulin resistance as determined by diminished GLUT4 translocation following insulin stimulation, the levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and reactive oxygen species were elevated in the neonatal hearts of IDM/W compared with that seen in the offspring born from non-diabetic control animals. Similarly, the receptor of AGEs (RAGE) mRNA levels, reactive oxygen species and the amount of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) mRNA were higher in the hearts from the IDM/W when compared to that observed in the hearts of offspring born to non-diabetic animals. These deleterious effects of gestational diabetes were significantly decreased in the offspring of diabetic mothers receiving EPA supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data suggest that the EPA in fish oil may improve the impaired signalling and the excessive protein glycation in the cardiac muscles of infants exposed to intrauterine hyperglycemia.|Non-Cancer
ID:28951259|Title:Chimerism in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and its correlation with the clinical outcome.Abstract:Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only hope to cure many inherited and acquired hematological disorders in children. Monitoring of chimerism helps to predict the post-transplantation events, with the intention to enhance the long-term disease free survival (DFS). The study aimed to investigate the importance of early chimerism detection to predict the clinical outcome following HSCT. The study included nine recipients (six beta-thalassemia and three severe aplastic anemia patients) and their 10/10 HLA identical sibling donors. Chimerism detection was performed by analysis of short tandem repeat (STR) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection and quantification of the relative amounts of donor and recipient cells present on day +28. Peripheral blood (PB) was the main stem cell source for HSC transplantation. Disease free survival (DFS) was 71.4% while overall survival was 85.7% for PBSC transplants at the median follow up period of 4years. The early detection of chimerism by PCR-STR analysis for children with beta-thalassemia and aplastic anemia correlated with the outcome of HSCT in 8 (88.8%) patients. Complete chimerism was associated with disease-free survival while mixed chimerism and autologous patterns were associated with poor prognosis. In conclusion, early chimerism testing is clinically important in prediction of outcome after allogeneic HSC transplantation.|Non-Cancer
ID:28951535|Title:Dimerization of the adaptor Gads facilitates antigen receptor signaling by promoting the cooperative binding of Gads to the adaptor LAT.Abstract:The accurate assembly of signalosomes centered on the adaptor protein LAT (linker of activated T cells) is required for antigen receptor signaling in T cells and mast cells. During signalosome assembly, members of the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) family of cytosolic adaptor proteins bind cooperatively to LAT through interactions with its phosphorylated tyrosine (pTyr) residues. We demonstrated the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-mediated dimerization of the Grb2 family member, Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (Gads). Gads dimerization was mediated by an SH2 domain interface, which is distinct from the pTyr binding pocket and which promoted cooperative, preferential binding of paired Gads to LAT. This SH2 domain-intrinsic mechanism of cooperativity, which we quantified by mathematical modeling, enabled Gads to discriminate between dually and singly phosphorylated LAT molecules. Mutational inactivation of the dimerization interface reduced cooperativity and abrogated Gads signaling in T cells and mast cells. The dimerization-dependent, cooperative binding of Gads to LAT may increase antigen receptor sensitivity by reducing signalosome formation at incompletely phosphorylated LAT molecules, thereby prioritizing the formation of complete signalosomes.|Non-Cancer
ID:28960434|Title:Utility and limitations of exome sequencing in the molecular diagnosis of pediatric inherited platelet disorders.Abstract:Inherited platelet disorders (IPD) are a heterogeneous group of rare disorders that affect platelet number and function and often predispose to other significant medical complications. In spite of the identification of over 50 IPD disease-associated genes, a molecular diagnosis is only identified in a minority (10%) of affected patients without a clinically suspected etiology. We studied a cohort of 21 pediatric patients with suspected IPDs by exome sequencing (ES) to: (1) examine the performance of the exome test for IPD genes, (2) determine if this exome-wide diagnostic test provided a higher diagnostic yield than has been previously reported, (3) to evaluate the frequency of variants of uncertain significance identified, and (4) to identify candidate variants for functional evaluation in patients with an uncertain or negative diagnosis. We established a high priority gene list of 53 genes, evaluated exome capture kit performance, and determined the coverage for these genes and disease-related variants. We identified likely disease causing variants in 5 of the 21 probands (23.8%) and variants of uncertain significance in 52% of patients studied. In conclusion, ES has the potential to molecularly diagnose causes of IPD, and to identify candidate genes for functional evaluation. Robust exome sequencing also requires that coverage of genes known to be associated with clinical findings of interest need to be carefully examined and supplemented if necessary. Clinicians who undertake ES should understand the limitations of the test and the full significance of results that may be returned.|Non-Cancer
ID:28967629|Title:Mutations in AIFM1 cause an X-linked childhood cerebellar ataxia partially responsive to riboflavin.Abstract:BACKGROUND: AIFM1 encodes a mitochondrial flavoprotein with a dual role (NADH oxidoreductase and regulator of apoptosis), which uses riboflavin as a cofactor. Mutations in the X-linked AIFM1 were reported in relation to two main phenotypes: a severe infantile mitochondrial encephalomyopathy and an early-onset axonal sensorimotor neuropathy with hearing loss. In this paper we report two unrelated males harboring AIFM1 mutations (one of which is novel) who display distinct phenotypes including progressive ataxia which partially improved with riboflavin treatment. METHODS: For both patients trio whole exome sequencing was performed. Validation and segregation were performed with Sanger sequencing. Following the diagnosis, patients were treated with up to 200 mg riboflavin/day for 12 months. Ataxia was assessed by the ICARS scale at baseline, and 6 and 12 months following treatment. RESULTS: Patient 1 presented at the age of 5 years with auditory neuropathy, followed by progressive ataxia, vermian atrophy and axonal neuropathy. Patient 2 presented at the age of 4.5 years with severe limb and palatal myoclonus, followed by ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, ophthalmoplegia, sensorineural hearing loss, hyporeflexia and cardiomyopathy. Two deleterious missense mutations were found in the AIFM1 gene: p. Met340Thr mutation located in the FAD dependent oxidoreductase domain and the novel p. Thr141Ile mutation located in a highly conserved DNA binding motif. Ataxia score, decreased by 39% in patient 1 and 20% in patient 2 following 12 months of treatment. CONCLUSION: AIFM1 mutations cause childhood cerebellar ataxia, which may be partially treatable in some patients with high dose riboflavin.|Non-Cancer
ID:29021147|Title:Atypical haematological presentation in a case of polycythaemia vera with a new variant mutation detected in exon 12: c.1605G>T (p.Met535Ile).Abstract:One of the major genetic insights into the pathogenesis of polycythaemia vera included the identification of the somatic point gain-of-function mutations in Janus kinase 2 gene-first JAK2V617F on exon 14, present in 95%-97% of the cases, and later on exon 12. In the literature, we can find some reported studies where different exon 12 mutations are identified. Unlike patients with JAK2V617F mutation in exon 14, the mutation at exon 12 is not usually associated with an increase in the three haematopoietic series (erythrocytosis, leucocytosis and thrombocytosis). It appears to be associated with a distinct syndrome, mostly characterised by isolated and more marked erythrocytosis, independently of the mutational variant. We report here the case of a patient who is JAK2exon 12 positive, presenting a novel mutation-c.1605G>T (p.Met535Ile)-associated with c.1612C>T (p.His538Tyr) mutation previously described, evidencing an atypical clinical phenotype.|Non-Cancer
ID:29059455|Title:Angiocrine Wnt signaling controls liver growth and metabolic maturation in mice.Abstract:Postnatal liver development is characterized by hepatocyte growth, proliferation, and functional maturation. Notably, canonical Wnt signaling in hepatocytes has been identified as an important regulator of final adult liver size and metabolic liver zonation. The cellular origin of Wnt ligands responsible for homeostatic liver/body weight ratio (LW/BW) remained unclear, which was also attributable to a lack of suitable endothelial Cre driver mice. To comprehensively analyze the effects of hepatic angiocrine Wnt signaling on liver development and metabolic functions, we used endothelial subtype-specific Stab2-Cre driver mice to delete Wls from hepatic endothelial cells (HECs). The resultant Stab2-Cretg/wt ;Wlsfl/fl (Wls-HECKO) mice were viable, but showed a significantly reduced LW/BW. Specifically, ablation of angiocrine Wnt signaling impaired metabolic zonation in the liver, as shown by loss of pericentral, beta-catenin-dependent target genes such as glutamine synthase (Glul), RhBg, Axin2, and cytochrome P450 2E1, as well as by extended expression of periportal genes such as arginase 1. Furthermore, endothelial subtype-specific expression of a c-terminally YFP-tagged Wls fusion protein in Wls-HECKO mice (Stab2-Cretg/wt ;Wlsfl/fl ;Rosa26:Wls-YFPfl/wt [Wls-rescue]) restored metabolic liver zonation. Interestingly, lipid metabolism was altered in Wls-HECKO mice exhibiting significantly reduced plasma cholesterol levels, while maintaining normal plasma triglyceride and blood glucose concentrations. On the contrary, zonal expression of Endomucin, LYVE1, and other markers of HEC heterogeneity were not altered in Wls-HECKO livers. CONCLUSION: Angiocrine Wnt signaling controls liver growth as well as development of metabolic liver zonation in mice, whereas intrahepatic HEC zonation is not affected. (Hepatology 2017).|Non-Cancer

These hemorrhagic lesions, for example, a ruptured pseudoaneurysm, are often treated by transarterial embolization (TAE), but prior intervention or surgery, inflammation, anatomic variants, and vessel tortuosity may render an endovascular approach challenging, time-consuming, and sometimes impossible. We report two cases of severe head and neck hemorrhages successfully embolized with n-butyl cyanoacrylate via direct puncture, and propose this approach as a fast, safe, and effective alternative to TAE.|Non-Cancer
ID:29101828|Title:JAK2V617F detection and allele burden measurement in saliva vs. peripheral blood in patients with myelofibrosis.Abstract:We previously demonstrated that peripheral blood (PB) is a reliable source for testing JAK2V617F mutation in patients with myelofibrosis (MF); saliva has also been tested to detect such mutation, however its diagnostic accuracy as compared to PB has not been validated. In this study, we prospectively tested 167 patients with MF for JAK2V617F mutation, using both saliva and PB collected at the same time from each patient. The concordance between the 2 sources was 96%, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 90%. The only factor associated with false positivity on saliva was ongoing transfusion dependency. JAK2V617F testing using saliva is a simple, non-invasive, and potentially a more reliable method than PB for measuring JAK2 status and assessing V617F allelic burden in patients with transfusion dependency.|Non-Cancer

ID:29133782|Title:mTOR intersects antibody-inducing signals from TACI in marginal zone B cells.Abstract:Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) enhances immunity in addition to orchestrating metabolism. Here we show that mTOR coordinates immunometabolic reconfiguration of marginal zone (MZ) B cells, a pre-activated lymphocyte subset that mounts antibody responses to T-cell-independent antigens through a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-amplified pathway involving transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI). This receptor interacts with mTOR via the TLR adapter MyD88. The resulting mTOR activation instigates MZ B-cell proliferation, immunoglobulin G (IgG) class switching, and plasmablast differentiation through a rapamycin-sensitive pathway that integrates metabolic and antibody-inducing transcription programs, including NF-kappaB. Disruption of TACI-mTOR interaction by rapamycin, truncation of the MyD88-binding domain of TACI, or B-cell-conditional mTOR deficiency interrupts TACI signaling via NF-kappaB and cooperation with TLRs, thereby hampering IgG production to T-cell-independent antigens but not B-cell survival. Thus, mTOR drives innate-like antibody responses by linking proximal TACI signaling events with distal immunometabolic transcription programs.|Non-Cancer
ID:29146131|Title:Dysregulation of autophagy in melanocytes contributes to hypopigmented macules in tuberous sclerosis complex.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) gene mutations lead to constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, resulting in a broad range of symptoms. Hypopigmented macules are the earliest sign. Although we have already confirmed that topical rapamycin treatment (an mTOR inhibitor) protects patients with TSC against macular hypopigmentation, the pathogenesis of such lesions remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: Recently emerging evidence supports a role for autophagy in skin pigmentation. Herein, we investigated the impact of autophagic dysregulation on TSC-associated hypopigmentation. METHODS: Skin samples from 10 patients with TSC, each bearing characteristic hypopigmented macules, and 6 healthy donors were subjected to immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses. In addition, TSC2-knockdown (KD) was investigated in human epidermal melanocytes by melanin content examination, real-time PCR, western blotting analyses, and intracellular immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Activation of the mTOR signaling pathway decreased melanocytic pigmentation in hypopigmented macules of patients with TSC and in TSC2-KD melanocytes. In addition, LC3 expression (a marker of autophagy) and autophagosome counts increased, whereas, intracellular accumulation of autophagic degradative substrates (p62 and ubiquitinated proteins) was evident in TSC2-KD melanocytes. Furthermore, depigmentation in TSC2-KD melanocytes was accelerated by inhibiting autophagy (ATG7-KD or bafilomycin A1-pretreatment) and was completely reversed by induction of autophagy via mTOR-dependent (rapamycin) or mTOR-independent (SMER28) exposure. Finally, dysregulation of autophagy, marked by increased LC3 expression and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, was also observed in melanocytes of TSC-related hypopigmented macules. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that melanocytes of patients with TSC display autophagic dysregulation, which thereby reduced pigmentation, serving as the basis for the hypomelanotic macules characteristic of TSC.|Non-Cancer
ID:29150943|Title:Muscle regeneration potential and satellite cell activation profile during recovery following hindlimb immobilization in mice.Abstract:Reduced muscle activity leads to muscle atrophy and function loss in patients and animal models. Satellite cells (SCs) are postnatal muscle stem cells that play a pivotal role in skeletal muscle regeneration following injury. The regenerative potential, satellite cell numbers, and markers during recovery following immobilization of the hindlimb for 7 days were explored. In mice exposed to 7 days of hindlimb immobilization, in those exposed to recovery (7 days, splint removal), and in contralateral control muscles, muscle precursor cells were isolated from all hindlimb muscles (fluorescence-activated cell sorting, FACS) and SCs, and muscle regeneration were identified using immunofluorescence (gastrocnemius and soleus) and electron microscopy (EM, gastrocnemius). Expression of ki67, pax7, myoD, and myogenin was quantified (RT-PCR) from SC FACS yields. Body and grip strength were determined. Following 7 day hindlimb immobilization, a decline in SCs (FACS, immunofluorescence) was observed together with an upregulation of SC activation markers and signs of muscle regeneration including fusion to existing myofibers (EM). Recovery following hindlimb immobilization was characterized by a program of muscle regeneration events. Hindlimb immobilization induced a decline in SCs together with an upregulation of markers of SC activation, suggesting that fusion to existing myofibers takes place during unloading. Muscle recovery induced a significant rise in muscle precursor cells and regeneration events along with reduced SC activation expression markers and a concomitant rise in terminal muscle differentiation expression. These are novel findings of potential applicability for the treatment of disuse muscle atrophy, which is commonly associated with severe chronic and acute conditions.|Non-Cancer
ID:29157620|Title:Unicentric Castleman Disease.Abstract:Unicentric Castleman disease (UCD) is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder that manifests typically as proliferation of a single lymph node or region of lymph nodes. Histologically, hyaline vascular variant is found in a majority of UCDs. UCD commonly presents in younger patient populations. Patients with UCD may be asymptomatic or present with symptoms related to mass effects on surrounding structures. It is difficult to achieve a definitive diagnosis by imaging alone. Histologic examination of the lesion remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Complete surgical resection is the best primary treatment modality for UCD resulting in excellent long-term survival and low recurrence rates.|Non-Cancer
ID:29171770|Title:Emerging biomarkers of lymphangioleiomyomatosis.Abstract:INTRODUCTION: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a destructive lung disease affecting primarily women. LAM is caused by inactivating mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes, resulting in hyperactivation of mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Over the past five years, there have been remarkable advances in the diagnosis and therapy of LAM, including the identification of vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) as a diagnostic biomarker and the US Food and Drug Administration approval of sirolimus as therapy for LAM. In appropriate clinical situations VEGF-D testing can make lung biopsy unnecessary to diagnose LAM. However, there remains an urgent unmet need for additional biomarkers of disease activity and/or response to therapy. Areas covered: This work reviews VEGF-D, an established LAM biomarker, and discusses emerging biomarkers, including circulating LAM cells, imaging, lipid, and metabolite biomarkers, focusing on those with the highest potential impact for LAM patients. Expert commentary: Ongoing research priorities include the development of validated biomarkers to 1) noninvasively diagnose LAM in women whose VEGF-D levels are not diagnostic, 2) accurately predict the likelihood of disease progression and 3) quantitatively measure disease activity and LAM cell burden. These biomarkers would enable personalized, precision clinical care and fast-track clinical trial implementation, with high clinical impact.|Non-Cancer
ID:29177536|Title:Novel biotechnological platform based on baculovirus occlusion bodies carrying Babesia bovis small antigenic peptides for the design of a diagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Abstract:Baculoviruses are large DNA virus of insects principally employed in recombinant protein expression. Its ability to form occlusion bodies (OBs), which are composed mainly of polyhedrin protein (POLH), makes them biotechnologically attractive, as these crystals (polyhedra) can incorporate foreign peptides and can be easily isolated. On the other hand, peptide microarrays allow rapid and inexpensive high-throughput serological screening of new candidates to be incorporated to OBs. To integrate these 2 biotechnological approaches, we worked on Babesia bovis, one of the causative agents of bovine babesiosis. Current molecular diagnosis of infection with B. bovis includes enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques, which use merozoite lysate obtained from infected bovine erythrocytes. However, it is important to produce recombinant antigens that replace the use of crude antigens. Here, we describe a new biotechnological platform for the design of indirect ELISAs based on 5 antigenic peptides of 15 amino acid residues of B. bovis (ApBb), selected from a peptide microarray and expressed as a fusion to POLH. An Sf9POLHE44G packaging cell line infected with recombinant baculoviruses carrying POLH-ApBb fusions yielded higher levels of chimeric polyhedra, highlighting the advantage of a trans-contribution of a mutant copy of polyhedrin. Finally, the use of dissolved recombinant polyhedra as antigens was successful in an ELISA assay, as B. bovis-positive sera recognized the fusion POLH-ApBb. Thus, the use of this platform resulted in a promising alternative for molecular diagnosis of relevant infectious diseases.|Non-Cancer
ID:29196283|Title:Ringed telangiectasias: an unusual presentation of telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans.Abstract:Telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans (TMEP) is a rare form of cutaneous mastocytosis. While most cutaneous mastocytoses occur in children and are asymptomatic, TMEP occurs predominantly in adults and is associated with systemic manifestations, requiring medical management. TMEP is typically characterised by scattered red-brown macules on the trunk and extremities, but must be differentiated from other telangiectatic conditions such as scleroderma, hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and telangiectasias secondary to cirrhosis. Practitioners must be aware that variants to the classic presentation of TMEP exist, such as the ringed telangiectasias we describe. Diagnostic workup including tissue biopsy must be considered in such patients after a thorough history and physical have been performed and other telangiectatic processes have been ruled out. The treatment of cutaneous mastocytosis aims at controlling symptoms and preventing mast cell degranulation. Cosmetic treatment includes the use ofPsoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy, total skin electron beam radiation and flashlamp pulsed-dye laser treatment.|Non-Cancer
ID:29237664|Title:Giant retrocardiac foregut duplication cyst presenting with left atrial compression and palpitations.Abstract:A 35-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of palpitations and shortness of breath. An ECG showed premature atrial contractions and episodes of supraventricular tachycardia. A subsequent echocardiogram showed a retrocardiac cystic mass that was compressing the left atrium. A CT scan confirmed these findings by showing a large left-sided posterior mediastinal cyst compressing the left atrium and pulmonary veins. The cyst was successfully excised from the retrocardiac position via left thoracotomy after which there was complete resolution of the palpitations. Histopathology showed it to be a mediastinal cyst, most likely a foregut duplication of the enterogenic variant. This is an extremely unusual case of foregut duplication cyst presenting with compression of the left atrium and pulmonary veins leading to atrial arrhythmias.|Non-Cancer
ID:29240865|Title:Mast Cell Burden in a Patient With Cutaneous DiseaseAbstract:Mastocytosis is a disease characterized by the abnormal clonal proliferation of mast cells in skin and/or extracutaneous organs, often relating to activating mutations of c-KIT. Histopathology special stains, such as Giemsa, Leder, and Toluidine blue, are key for the diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis (CM). In adults, skin lesions can be associated with systemic disease. Tryptase is a diagnostic marker in mastocytosis and thought to reflect the burden of mast cell disease. In this report, we present a case of cutaneous mast cell disease with associated findings of elevated serum tryptase and mast cell infiltration of the bone marrow consistent with indolent systemic mastocytosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:29249553|Title:Liver Angiomyolipomas in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex-Their Incidence and Course.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology and clinical significance of hepatic angiomyolipomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging data from 187 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. The prevalence, progression, and potential relationship between liver lesions and other clinical findings, including genetic associations, were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 187 patients (14.9%) had hepatic lesions. There was a predominance of female over male patients in individuals with liver lesions (17 versus 11), with statistical significance in patients under five years of age (P < 0.05). All individuals having hepatic lesions who also had available genetic testing data (n = 20) were diagnosed with a TSC2 gene mutation. All patients with liver lesions had coexisting renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) (P < 0.05). The age of onset of renal lesions was lower and their prevalence was significantly higher in patients with liver involvement (P < 0.05). In most instances, hepatic lesions measured several millimeters in diameter and were clinically asymptomatic. Progressive lesion growth was documented in six individuals but with no clinical consequences to date. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the association of hepatic lesions with TSC2 mutations, a common origin of liver and renal AMLs, as well as the predominance of female patients in this group. Hepatic AMLs are relatively common but mostly benign lesions.|Non-Cancer
ID:29271416|Title:Cryo-EM structure of human ATR-ATRIP complex.Abstract:ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related) protein kinase and ATRIP (ATR-interacting protein) form a complex and play a critical role in response to replication stress and DNA damage. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structure of the human ATR-ATRIP complex at 4.7 A resolution and built an atomic model of the C-terminal catalytic core of ATR (residues 1 521-2 644) at 3.9 A resolution. The complex adopts a hollow "heart" shape, consisting of two ATR monomers in distinct conformations. The EM map for ATRIP reveals 14 HEAT repeats in an extended "S" shape. The conformational flexibility of ATR allows ATRIP to properly lock the N-termini of the two ATR monomers to favor ATR-ATRIP complex formation and functional diversity. The isolated "head-head" and "tail-tail" each adopts a pseudo 2-fold symmetry. The catalytic pockets face outward and substrate access is not restricted by inhibitory elements. Our studies provide a structural basis for understanding the assembly of the ATR-ATRIP complex and a framework for characterizing ATR-mediated DNA repair pathways.|Non-Cancer
ID:29276006|Title:WNT Signaling Perturbations Underlie the Genetic Heterogeneity of Robinow Syndrome.Abstract:Locus heterogeneity characterizes a variety of skeletal dysplasias often due to interacting or overlapping signaling pathways. Robinow syndrome is a skeletal disorder historically refractory to molecular diagnosis, potentially stemming from substantial genetic heterogeneity. All current known pathogenic variants reside in genes within the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway including ROR2, WNT5A, and more recently, DVL1 and DVL3. However, ~70% of autosomal-dominant Robinow syndrome cases remain molecularly unsolved. To investigate this missing heritability, we recruited 21 families with at least one family member clinically diagnosed with Robinow or Robinow-like phenotypes and performed genetic and genomic studies. In total, four families with variants in FZD2 were identified as well as three individuals from two families with biallelic variants in NXN that co-segregate with the phenotype. Importantly, both FZD2 and NXN are relevant protein partners in the WNT5A interactome, supporting their role in skeletal development. In addition to confirming that clustered -1 frameshifting variants in DVL1 and DVL3 are the main contributors to dominant Robinow syndrome, we also found likely pathogenic variants in candidate genes GPC4 and RAC3, both linked to the Wnt signaling pathway. These data support an initial hypothesis that Robinow syndrome results from perturbation of the Wnt/PCP pathway, suggest specific relevant domains of the proteins involved, and reveal key contributors in this signaling cascade during human embryonic development. Contrary to the view that non-allelic genetic heterogeneity hampers gene discovery, this study demonstrates the utility of rare disease genomic studies to parse gene function in human developmental pathways.|Non-Cancer
ID:29288088|Title:Telangiectasias in Ataxia Telangiectasia: Clinical significance, role of ATM deficiency and potential pathophysiological mechanisms.Abstract:Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) is named after the two key clinical features that characterize its classical phenotype, namely a progressive cerebellar gait disorder (ataxia) and vascular anomalies (telangiectasias) visible in the conjunctivae and skin. AT is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder, caused by mutations in the ATM gene that encodes the ATM protein. While the ataxia is subject of many publications, the telangiectasias are under emphasised. We here describe the observation that the absence or presence of ATM protein and the level of residual ATM kinase activity are related to the occurrence of telangiectasias and describe the clinical consequences of these vascular malformations. Finally, we hypothesize that ATM dysfunction dysregulates angiogenesis.|Non-Cancer
ID:29298625|Title:Initial romiplostim dosing and time to platelet response in patients with treatment refractory immune thrombocytopenia.Abstract:BACKGROUND/RATIONALE: Romiplostim is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist recommended as a second-line therapy for immune thrombocytopenia. An initial dose of 1 mcg/kg/week subcutaneously with weekly 1 mcg/kg dose escalation is recommended per package labeling. Optimizing romiplostim dosing for hospitalized, corticosteroid- and intravenous immunoglobulin-refractory patients with severe thrombocytopenia secondary to immune thrombocytopenia may be critical for improving platelet responses, reducing the risk of bleeding, and decreasing hospital length of stay. Limited data are available evaluating the efficacy and safety of higher initial doses. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to compare the time to platelet >= 10 x 109/L between patients who received an initial romiplostim dose of >=2 mcg/kg/week compared to the standard initial dose of 1 mcg/kg/week. Secondary objectives included time to platelet response >= 30 x 109/L and >=50 x 109/L, percentage of patients achieving platelet responses, hospital length of stay, and incidence of adverse events and bleeding complications. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center, cohort study including hospitalized adults with corticosteroid- and intravenous immunoglobulin-refractory immune thrombocytopenia. A baseline platelet < 10 x 109/L was required. Patients were stratified by their initial romiplostim dose into Cohort 1 (1 mcg/kg/week) and Cohort 2 (>=2 mcg/kg/week). A review of electronic medical records and descriptive statistics generated findings. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients were included, 4 in Cohort 1 and 14 in Cohort 2. Patients in Cohort 2 had a median initial dose of 4.5 mcg/kg/week. Patients in Cohort 2 achieved a platelet >= 10 x 109/L in a median of 2 days versus 4.5 days for Cohort 1. More patients in Cohort 2 achieved a platelet >= 30 x 109/L (42.9% vs. 25%) and platelet >= 50 x 109/L (28.6% vs. 25%). The median hospital length of stay was shorter in Cohort 2 (13.5 vs. 20 days). Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was noted less frequently in Cohort 2 (28.6% vs. 75%), while major bleeding was more frequent in Cohort 2 (14.3% vs. 0%). No thrombotic events occurred. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that higher initial romiplostim doses may be safe for hospitalized patients with treatment-refractory immune thrombocytopenia. Compared to Food and Drug Administration-approved dosing, higher initial doses may shorten time to platelet responses and hospital length of stay. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.|Non-Cancer
ID:29305257|Title:The expression of mCTLA-4 in skin lesion inversely correlates with the severity of psoriasis.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by epidermal hyperplasia and increased T cell infiltration. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a key factor that affects T cell function and immune response. However, whether the expression of CTLA-4 affects the severity of psoriasis is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the project was to investigate the correlation between the expression of CTLA-4 and the severity of psoriasis. METHODS: The plasma soluble CTLA-4 levels and membrane CTLA-4 expression were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry analysis in mild, moderate and severe psoriasis patients, respectively. Imiquimod-induced mouse model of psoriasis was treated with CTLA-4 immunoglobulin fusion protein (CTLA-4 Ig) or anti-CTLA-4 antibody. Epidermal thickness and infiltrating CD3+ T cell counts were evaluated. RESULTS: The plasma soluble CTLA-4 levels had no significant difference among mild, moderate, and severe patients (p > 0.05). However, the membrane CTLA-4 expression in skin was significantly higher in mild psoriasis patients compared to moderate and severe psoriasis patients (17652.86 +- 18095.66 vs 6901.36 +- 4400.77 vs 3970.24 +- 5509.15, p < 0.001). Furthermore, in imiquimod-induced mouse model of psoriasis, the results showed that mimicking CTLA-4 function improved the skin phenotype and reduced epidermal thickness (172.87 +- 28.25 vs 245.87 +- 36.61 mum, n = 6, p < 0.01) as well as infiltrating CD3+ T cell counts (5.09 +- 3.45 vs 13.45 +- 4.70, p < 0.01) compared to control group. However, blocking CTLA-4 function aggregated the skin phenotype including enhanced epidermal thickness and infiltrating CD3+ T cell counts compared to control group. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that the expression of mCTLA-4 in skin lesion inversely correlated with the severity of psoriasis and CTLA-4 might play a critical role in the disease severity of psoriasis.|Non-Cancer
ID:29330464|Title:Eltrombopag versus romiplostim in treatment of children with persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia: a systematic review incorporating an indirect-comparison meta-analysis.Abstract:In absence of direct comparison, we conducted an indirect-comparison meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of thrombopoietin-receptor agonists(TPO-RAs) in treatment of pediatric persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia(ITP). PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials.gov, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database were searched from their earliest records to May 2017. Randomized controlled trials comparing the TPO-RAs with placebo in pediatric ITP were included. Outcomes included overall response rate(primary), durable response, overall or clinically significant bleeding, the proportion of patients receiving rescue medication, and safety. Five randomized placebo-controlled studies(N = 261) were analyzed. The overall response[Risk Ratio(RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval(CI) 0.21-1.56], the incidence of adverse events (RR 0.96, 95%CI 0.66-1.39), durable response(RR 2.48, 95%CI 0.31-19.97), and the proportion of patients receiving rescue treatment(RR 0.73, 95%CI 0.20-2.73) were similar between eltrombopag and romiplostim group. Nevertheless, eltrombopag might have lower risk of overall bleeding(RR 0.43, 95%CI 0.23-0.80) and clinically significant bleeding(RR 0.33, 95%CI 0.12-0.89) than romiplostim. This meta-analysis suggests that eltrombopag might be similar to romiplostim in efficacy and safety, but seems to reduce the risk of bleeding compared to romiplostim. Furthermore, cost of the treatment, comorbidity of patients and drug compliance should also be considered in clinical decision making.|Non-Cancer
ID:29331029|Title:Characterization of CD34+ hematopoietic cells in systemic mastocytosis: Potential role in disease dissemination.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Recent studies show that most systemic mastocytosis (SM) patients, including indolent SM (ISM) with (ISMs+) and without skin lesions (ISMs-), carry the KIT D816V mutation in PB leukocytes. We investigated the potential association between the degree of involvement of BM hematopoiesis by the KIT D816V mutation and the distribution of different maturation-associated compartments of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ hematopoietic precursors (HPC) in ISM and identified the specific PB cell compartments that carry this mutation. METHODS: The distribution of different maturation-associated subsets of BM and PB CD34+ HPC from 64 newly diagnosed (KIT-mutated) ISM patients and 14 healthy controls was analyzed by flow cytometry. In 18 patients, distinct FACS-purified PB cell compartments were also investigated for the KIT mutation. RESULTS: ISM patients showed higher percentages of both BM and PB MC-committed CD34+ HPC vs controls, particularly among ISM cases with MC-restricted KIT mutation (ISMMC ); this was associated with progressive blockade of maturation of CD34+ HPC to the neutrophil lineage from ISMMC to multilineage KIT-mutated cases (ISMML ). Regarding the frequency of KIT-mutated cases and cell populations in PB, variable patterns were observed, the percentage of KIT-mutated PB CD34+ HPC, eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes and T cells increasing from ISMs-MC and ISMs+MC to ISMML patients. CONCLUSION: The presence of the KIT D816V mutation in PB of ISM patients is associated with (early) involvement of circulating CD34+ HPC and multiple myeloid cell subpopulations, KIT-mutated PB CD34+ HPC potentially contributing to early dissemination of the disease.|Non-Cancer
ID:29339522|Title:Effect of beta-agonists on LAM progression and treatment.Abstract:Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare disease of women, is associated with cystic lung destruction resulting from the proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle-like LAM cells with mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes TSC1 and/or TSC2 The mutant genes and encoded proteins are responsible for activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is inhibited by sirolimus (rapamycin), a drug used to treat LAM. Patients who have LAM may also be treated with bronchodilators for asthma-like symptoms due to LAM. We observed stabilization of forced expiratory volume in 1 s over time in patients receiving sirolimus and long-acting beta-agonists with short-acting rescue inhalers compared with patients receiving only sirolimus. Because beta-agonists increase cAMP and PKA activity, we investigated effects of PKA activation on the mTOR pathway. Human skin TSC2+/- fibroblasts or LAM lung cells incubated short-term with isoproterenol (beta-agonist) showed a sirolimus-independent increase in phosphorylation of S6, a downstream effector of the mTOR pathway, and increased cell growth. Cells incubated long-term with isoproterenol, which may lead to beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization, did not show increased S6 phosphorylation. Inhibition of PKA blocked the isoproterenol effect on S6 phosphorylation. Thus, activation of PKA by beta-agonists increased phospho-S6 independent of mTOR, an effect abrogated by beta-agonist-driven receptor desensitization. In agreement, retrospective clinical data from patients with LAM suggested that a combination of bronchodilators in conjunction with sirolimus may be preferable to sirolimus alone for stabilization of pulmonary function.|Non-Cancer
ID:29357781|Title:Dynamic dosing of romiplostim in patients with immune thrombocytopenia purpura: Two case reports.Abstract:Romiplostim is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist approved for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia purpura. When following FDA-approved romiplostim prescribing recommendations to withhold treatment for platelet counts above 400k/microL, some patients exhibit a precipitous decline in their platelet count potentially causing patient harm. We present two cases where stable platelet counts were achieved only through persistent weekly dosing of romiplostim despite platelet counts above 400k/microL on the day of administration. Therefore, continuous weekly dosing of romiplostim despite platelet count being above 400k/microL combined with twice weekly vigilant monitoring is an alternative method of romiplostim dosing that mitigates severe fluctuations in platelets. We also discuss important details, postulated mechanisms, and evidence-based mitigation strategies.|Non-Cancer
ID:29370381|Title:Ablation of Grb10 Specifically in Muscle Impacts Muscle Size and Glucose Metabolism in Mice.Abstract:Grb10 is an adaptor-type signaling protein most highly expressed in tissues involved in insulin action and glucose metabolism, such as muscle, pancreas, and adipose. Germline deletion of Grb10 in mice creates a phenotype with larger muscles and improved glucose homeostasis. However, it has not been determined whether Grb10 ablation specifically in muscle is sufficient to induce hypermuscularity or affect whole body glucose metabolism. In this study we generated muscle-specific Grb10-deficient mice (Grb10-mKO) by crossing Grb10flox/flox mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the human alpha-skeletal actin promoter. One-year-old Grb10-mKO mice had enlarged muscles, with greater cross-sectional area of fibers compared with wild-type (WT) mice. This degree of hypermuscularity did not affect whole body glucose homeostasis under basal conditions. However, hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp studies revealed that Grb10-mKO mice had greater glucose uptake into muscles compared with WT mice. Insulin signaling was increased at the level of phospho-Akt in muscle of Grb10-mKO mice compared with WT mice, consistent with a role of Grb10 as a modulator of proximal insulin receptor signaling. We conclude that ablation of Grb10 in muscle is sufficient to affect muscle size and metabolism, supporting an important role for this protein in growth and metabolic pathways.|Non-Cancer
ID:29385279|Title:Chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK-cells: A single-institution review with emphasis on relative utility of multimodality diagnostic tools.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK-cells (CLPD-NK) manifests as a persistent increase (>=2 x 109 /L, for > 6 months) of mature NK-cells in peripheral blood with an indolent clinical course. The disease is rare, and only limited case series have been published. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 11 patients with CLPD-NK diagnosed at our institution between 2005 and 2017. RESULTS: Patients included 7 men and 4 women with a median age of 60 years (range, 25-89 years). Ten patients (91%) had cytopenias. Bone marrow involvement by CLPD-NK ranged from 5-15%. The most commonly detected antigenic aberrancies by  low cytometry immunophenotyping were as follows: CD7decreased/dim (30%), CD8uniform+ (36%), CD56-/partial (73%), CD94bright (55%), and KIR restriction (100%). JAK/STAT pathway mutations were detected in 8 of 10 (80%) patients and involved STAT3 (n = 7) and JAK3 (n = 1). The presence of mutations tended to correlate with the occurrence of other cytopenias (anemia/thrombocytopenia) and requirement for treatment. Seven patients received single-agent therapy, with amelioration of symptoms; 4 patients were observed. There were no disease-associated deaths or progression to more aggressive disease during the follow-up interval (median, 17 months). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CLPD-NK have an indolent clinical course and frequent hematologic manifestations that are responsive to single-agent therapy. Mutations in STAT3 are common and portend more pronounced clinical manifestations.|Non-Cancer
ID:29411231|Title:Analysis of Chronic Granulomatous Disease in the Kavkazi Population in Israel Reveals Phenotypic Heterogeneity in Patients with the Same NCF1 mutation (c.579G>A).Abstract:PURPOSE: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an innate immune deficiency disorder of phagocytes, resulting from mutations in the components of the NADPH oxidase complex that impair the synthesis of oxygen radicals, thus rendering patients susceptible to recurrent infections and excessive hyperinflammatory responses. The most common autosomal recessive form of CGD is p47phox deficiency, which is often clinically milder than the more common X-linked recessive form. Here, we report data on genetics, clinical and biochemical findings in 17 CGD patients of Kavkazi origin with the nonsense mutation c.579G>A in the NCF1 gene, leading to p47phox deficiency. METHODS: Diagnosis was based on detailed clinical evaluation, respiratory burst activity by cytochrome c reduction and dihydrorhodamine-1,2,3 (DHR) assay by flow cytometry, expression of p47phox by immunoblotting and molecular confirmation by DNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twelve male and five female patients with median age at onset of 2.5 years (range 1 day to 9 years) were included in the study. The present cohort displays an encouraging 88% overall long-term survival, with median follow-up of 17 years. Clinical manifestations varied from mild to severe expression of the disease. Correlation between genotype and phenotype is unpredictable, although the Kavkazi patients were more severely affected than other patients with p47phox deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Kavkazi CGD patients harbor a common genetic mutation that is associated with a heterogeneous clinical phenotype. Early diagnosis and proper clinical management in an experienced phagocytic leukocyte center is imperative to ensure favorable patient outcome. New treatment strategies are ongoing, but results are not yet conclusive.|Non-Cancer
ID:29428355|Title:Dissecting Wnt Signaling for Melanocyte Regulation during Wound Healing.Abstract:Abnormal pigmentation is commonly seen in the wound scar. Despite advancements in the research of wound healing, little is known about the repopulation of melanocytes in the healed skin. Previous studies have shown the capacity of melanocyte stem cells in the hair follicle to contribute skin epidermal melanocytes after injury in mice and humans. Here, we focused on the Wnt pathway, known to be a vital regulator of melanocyte stem cells in efforts to better understand the regulation of follicle-derived epidermal melanocytes during wound healing. We showed that transgenic expression of Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 in melanocytes reduced epidermal melanocytes in the wound scar. Conversely, forced activation of Wnt signaling by genetically stabilizing beta-catenin in melanocytes increases epidermal melanocytes. Furthermore, we show that deletion of Wntless (Wls), a gene required for Wnt ligand secretion, within epithelial cells results in failure in activating Wnt signaling in adjacent epidermal melanocytes. These results show the essential function of extrinsic Wnt ligands in initiating Wnt signaling in follicle-derived epidermal melanocytes during wound healing. Collectively, our results suggest the potential for Wnt signal regulation to promote melanocyte regeneration and provide a potential molecular window to promote proper melanocyte regeneration after wounding and in conditions such as vitiligo.|Non-Cancer

He developed an acute kidney injury requiring supportive treatment and on day 3 of his illness was noted to have developed severe rhabdomyolysis (creatine kinase level 132 040 U/L (normal <320 U/L)). He was born from consanguineous parents with homozygous mutations in the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor. He had skeletal dysplasia with metabolic bone disease and episodes of hyperthermia with lactic acidosis. He also had paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia treated with prophylactic propranolol. This is a case report of a child with SWS who had a febrile illness and epileptic seizures which led to severe rhabdomyolysis outside the context of anaesthesia, and we would like to draw the attention of clinicians to this potential complication.|Non-Cancer
ID:29458761|Title:Methods to Study DNA End Resection I: Recombinant Protein Purification.Abstract:Accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is carried out by homologous recombination. In order to repair DNA breaks by the recombination pathway, the 5'-terminated DNA strand at DSB sites must be first nucleolytically processed to produce 3'-overhang. The process is termed DNA end resection and involves the interplay of several nuclease complexes. DNA end resection commits DSB repair to the recombination pathway including a process termed single-strand annealing, as resected DNA ends are generally nonligatable by the competing nonhomologous end-joining machinery. Biochemical reconstitution experiments provided invaluable mechanistic insights into the DNA end resection pathways. In this chapter, we describe preparation procedures of key proteins involved in DNA end resection in human cells, including the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex, phosphorylated variant of CtIP, the DNA2 nuclease-helicase with its helicase partners Bloom (BLM) or Werner (WRN), as well as the single-stranded DNA-binding protein replication protein A. The availability of recombinant DNA end resection factors will help to further elucidate resection mechanisms and regulatory processes that may involve novel protein partners and posttranslational modifications.|Non-Cancer
ID:29463272|Title:Colonic perineurioma (benign fibroblastic polyp): case report and review of the literature.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Colorectal perineuriomas are uncommon benign mucosal-based proliferations of mesenchymal cells that express perineurial markers, often associated with colonic crypts displaying a serrated/hyperplastic architecture. The vast majority of cases arise distal to the splenic flexure and have been described as sessile polyps. Using molecular analysis, BRAF mutations have been demonstrated in the serrated crypt epithelium. We report a new case of perineurioma presenting as a pedunculated polyp in the transverse colon, with prominent hemosiderin deposits in the uninvolved lamina propria that separated the perineurial proliferation from the surface epithelium, a previously unreported histological finding. By using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated the presence of BRAF V600E mutated protein in the serrated crypt epithelium. In addition, a review of the literature on colorectal perineurioma is provided. CASE PRESENTATION: A 5 mm pedunculated polyp was removed from the transverse colon of a 42 year old man who presented with epigastric pain, weight loss and rectal bleeding. A proliferation of uniform plump spindled cells expanded the lamina propria and separated serrated colonic crypts. The epithelial component closely resembled microvesicular hyperplastic polyp. Immunohistochemical stains for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and collagen IV were positive in the stromal proliferation. A mutation-specific monoclonal antibody directed against BRAF V600E showed positive cytoplasmic staining in the serrated crypt epithelium but not in the perineurial proliferation. Conspicuous hemosiderin deposition was seen in the inflamed lamina propria between the perineurial proliferation and the surface epithelium. CONCLUSION: Although the majority of colorectal perineuriomas occur in the sigmoid colon and rectum and are described as sessile polyps, colorectal perineurioma can present as a pedunculated polyp proximal to the splenic flexure as described in this case. Conspicuous hemosiderin deposition can be seen in the superficial lamina propria. BRAF mutations are limited to the serrated crypt epithelium.|Non-Cancer
ID:29478616|Title:Tuberous sclerosis complex.Abstract:Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal-dominant or sporadic multisystem disorder that results from mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. The primary organs affected include the brain, skin, lung, kidney, and heart, all with variable frequency, penetrance, and severity. There are over 2000 known allelic variants for TSC, including nonsense and misssense mutation, and all pathogenic mutations are inactivating, leading to loss-of-function effects on the encoded proteins, TSC1 and TSC2. These proteins form a complex to constitutively inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade, and as a consequence, mTOR signaling is constitutively active within all TSC-associated lesions. The mTOR inhibitors rapamycin (sirolimus) and everolimus have been shown to reduce renal and brain lesion size, and improve pulmonary function in TSC, and these compounds may also decrease seizure frequency. The clinical application of mTOR inhibitors in TSC has provided one of the first examples of precision medicine in a neurodevelopmental disorder.|Non-Cancer

ID:29519755|Title:Osteopontin-deficient progenitor cells display enhanced differentiation to adipocytes.Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Osteopontin (OPN, Spp1) is a protein upregulated in white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese subjects. Deletion of OPN protects mice from high-fat diet-induced WAT inflammation and insulin resistance. However, the alterations mediated by loss of OPN in WAT before the obesogenic challenge have not yet been investigated. Therefore, we hypothesised that the lack of OPN might enhance the pro-adipogenic micro environment before obesity driven inflammation. METHODS: OPN deficiency was tested in visceral (V) and subcutaneous (SC) WAT from WT and Spp1-/- female mice. Gene expression for hypoxia, inflammation and adipogenesis was checked in WT vs. Spp1-/- mice (n=15). Adipocytes progenitor cells (APC) were isolated by fluorescence cell sorting and role of OPN deficiency in adipogenesis was investigated by cell images and RT-PCR. RESULTS: We show that Spp1-/- maintained normal body and fat-pad weights, although hypoxia and inflammation markers were significantly reduced. In contrast, expression of genes involved in adipogenesis was increased in WAT from Spp1-/- mice. Strikingly, APC from Spp1-/- were diminished but differentiated more efficiently to adipocytes than those from control mice. CONCLUSIONS: APC from SC-WAT of lean OPN-deficient mice display an enhanced capacity for differentiating to adipocytes. These alterations may explain the healthy expansion of WAT in the OPN-deficient model which is associated with reduced inflammation and insulin resistance.|Non-Cancer
ID:29525761|Title:Rare case of thoracic endometriosis presenting with lung nodules and pneumothorax.Abstract:We present the case of a 34-year-old Nigerian woman who was referred to the Respiratory team with a 12-month history of breathlessness. She was concurrently being investigated for an abdominal mass and rectal and vaginal bleeding. Consequently, she underwent cross-sectional imaging of her chest, abdomen and pelvis, revealing a small right-sided pneumothorax and right lower lobe pleural-based lesion. Shortly thereafter, she was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and required chest drain insertion. This partially treated her pneumothorax but she required referral to a cardiothoracic centre for definitive diagnosis and to manage her non-resolving pneumothorax. Biopsies from the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery confirmed the very rare diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:29535107|Title:Diagnosis of sporadic neurofibromatosis type 2 in the paediatric population.Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Onset of symptoms in severe sporadic neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is typically within childhood; however, there is poor awareness of presenting features in young children, potentially resulting in delayed diagnosis and poorer outcome. We have reviewed presentation of sporadic paediatric NF2 to raise awareness of early features, highlighting those requiring further investigation. DESIGN: Patients diagnosed with NF2 at age <=16 and seen between 2012 and 2015 were notified via the British Paediatric Neurology Surveillance Unit or identified through the English NF2 service. RESULTS: Epidemiological data estimate that 1 in 110 611 births are affected with childhood-onset NF2. Notes of 32 patients with sporadic NF2 were reviewed. Of those presenting under the age of 5, 89% (17/19) had ocular, 74% (14/19) dermatological and 58% (11/19) neurological signs; in 84% (16/19) features were multisystemic. Sixty-six per cent (21/32) had >=1 atypical feature, including cerebellar hypoplasia in three cases (9%) and focal cortical dysplasia in five out of seven seizure-related presentations. Five cases presented with a sometimes transient or intermittent cranial nerve mononeuropathy. The mean delay to diagnosis was 3.16 years; in eight cases (25%) this exceeded 6 years. Most significant delay occurred in mononeuropathy, ophthalmological and/or seizure presentations, with a mean delay of 3, 4.5 and 6 years, respectively. Eighty-four per cent (27/32) of cases needed intervention in childhood. CONCLUSIONS: All non-vestibular schwannoma NF2 presentations in childhood had significant diagnostic delay. We emphasise the importance of detailed assessment of skin and eyes in unusual presentations and propose an aide to prompt timely referral to specialist services.|Non-Cancer
ID:29540686|Title:A non-conserved amino acid variant regulates differential signalling between human and mouse CD28.Abstract:CD28 superagonistic antibodies (CD28SAb) can preferentially activate and expand immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) in mice. However, pre-clinical trials assessing CD28SAbs for the therapy of autoimmune diseases reveal severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome in humans, thereby implying the existence of distinct signalling abilities between human and mouse CD28. Here, we show that a single amino acid variant within the C-terminal proline-rich motif of human and mouse CD28 (P212 in human vs. A210 in mouse) regulates CD28-induced NF-kappaB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression. Moreover, this Y209APP212 sequence in humans is crucial for the association of CD28 with the Nck adaptor protein for actin cytoskeleton reorganisation events necessary for CD28 autonomous signalling. This study thus unveils different outcomes between human and mouse CD28 signalling to underscore the importance of species difference when transferring results from preclinical models to the bedside.|Non-Cancer
ID:29545013|Title:Clinic, pathogenic mechanisms and drug testing of two inherited thrombocytopenias, ANKRD26-related Thrombocytopenia and MYH9-related diseases.Abstract:Inherited thrombocytopenias (ITs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by low platelet count resulting in impaired hemostasis. Patients can have spontaneous hemorrhages and/or excessive bleedings provoked by hemostatic challenges as trauma or surgery. To date, ITs encompass 32 different rare monogenic disorders caused by mutations of 30 genes. This review will focus on the major discoveries that have been made in the last years on the diagnosis, treatment and molecular mechanisms of ANKRD26-Related Thrombocytopenia and MYH9-Related Diseases. Furthermore, we will discuss the use a Thrombopoietin mimetic as a novel approach to treat the thrombocytopenia in these patients. We will propose the use of a new 3D bone marrow model to study the mechanisms of action of these drugs and to test their efficacy and safety in patients. The overall purpose of this review is to point out that important progresses have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of ANKRD26-Related Thrombocytopenia and MYH9-Related Diseases and new therapeutic approaches have been proposed and tested. Future advancement in this research will rely in the development of more physiological models to study the regulation of human platelet biogenesis, disease mechanisms and specific pharmacologic targets.|Non-Cancer
ID:29549173|Title:Clinical spectrum of pyruvate kinase deficiency: data from the Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency Natural History Study.Abstract:An international, multicenter registry was established to collect retrospective and prospective clinical data on patients with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, the most common glycolytic defect causing congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Medical history and laboratory and radiologic data were retrospectively collected at enrollment for 254 patients with molecularly confirmed PK deficiency. Perinatal complications were common, including anemia that required transfusions, hyperbilirubinemia, hydrops, and prematurity. Nearly all newborns were treated with phototherapy (93%), and many were treated with exchange transfusions (46%). Children age 5 years and younger were often transfused until splenectomy. Splenectomy (150 [59%] of 254 patients) was associated with a median increase in hemoglobin of 1.6 g/dL and a decreased transfusion burden in 90% of patients. Predictors of a response to splenectomy included higher presplenectomy hemoglobin (P = .007), lower indirect bilirubin (P = .005), and missense PKLR mutations (P = .0017). Postsplenectomy thrombosis was reported in 11% of patients. The most frequent complications included iron overload (48%) and gallstones (45%), but other complications such as aplastic crises, osteopenia/bone fragility, extramedullary hematopoiesis, postsplenectomy sepsis, pulmonary hypertension, and leg ulcers were not uncommon. Overall, 87 (34%) of 254 patients had both a splenectomy and cholecystectomy. In those who had a splenectomy without simultaneous cholecystectomy, 48% later required a cholecystectomy. Although the risk of complications increases with severity of anemia and a genotype-phenotype relationship was observed, complications were common in all patients with PK deficiency. Diagnostic testing for PK deficiency should be considered in patients with apparent congenital hemolytic anemia and close monitoring for iron overload, gallstones, and other complications is needed regardless of baseline hemoglobin. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02053480.|Non-Cancer
ID:29550597|Title:Buckling Collapse of Midcervical Spine Secondary to Neurofibromatosis.Abstract:Buckling collapse is the term typically used to describe severe kyphosis >100 degrees, characteristically seen in thoracolumbar tuberculosis. Neurofibromatosis is rarely associated with severe cervical kyphosis. Dystrophic changes in vertebra make surgical correction and fusion challenging. Single-stage cervical osteotomies (e.g., pedicle subtraction osteotomy, vertebral column resection) are commonly done in cervicothoracic junction. However, it is technically challenging and associated with high risk of vertebral artery injury, neural injury, etc. when performed in higher cervical spine. Hence in our case we did a staged procedure performing circumferential osteotomy for buckling kyphosis in the midcervical spine. Because it involved midcervical spine and there was no chin-to-chest deformity, we preferred the anterior-posterior-anterior sequence.|Non-Cancer
ID:29557343|Title:Chemotherapy-Related Cardiac Dysfunction: A Systematic Review of Genetic Variants Modulating Individual Risk.Abstract:Chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction is a significant side effect of anticancer treatment. Risk stratification is based on clinical- and treatment-related risk factors that do not adequately explain individual susceptibility. The addition of genetic variants may improve risk assessment. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase, to identify studies investigating genetic risk factors for chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction. Included were articles describing genetic variants in humans altering susceptibility to chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction. The validity of identified studies was assessed by 10 criteria, including assessment of population stratification, statistical methodology, and replication of findings. We identified 40 studies: 34 exploring genetic risk factors for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (n=9678) and 6 studies related to trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity (n=642). The majority (35/40) of studies had a candidate gene approach, whereas 5 genome-wide association studies have been performed. We identified 25 genetic variants in 20 genes and 2 intergenic variants reported significant at least once. The overall validity of studies was limited, with small cohorts, failure to assess population ancestry and lack of replication. SNPs with the most robust evidence up to this point are CELF4 rs1786814 (sarcomere structure and function), RARG rs2229774 (topoisomerase-2beta expression), SLC28A3 rs7853758 (drug transport), UGT1A6 rs17863783 (drug metabolism), and 1 intergenic variant (rs28714259). Existing evidence supports the hypothesis that genetic variation contributes to chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction. Although many variants identified by this systematic review show potential to improve risk stratification, future studies are necessary for validation and assessment of their value in a diagnostic and prognostic setting.|Non-Cancer
ID:29610969|Title:Bendamustine and rituximab (BR) versus dexamethasone, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide (DRC) in patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.Abstract:The treatment approaches for Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) are largely based upon information from single-arm phase II trials, without comparative data. We compared the efficacy of two commonly used regimens in routine practice (bendamustine-rituximab (BR) and dexamethasone, rituximab plus cyclophosphamide (DRC)) and evaluated their activity with respect to the patients' MYD88L265P mutation status. Of 160 consecutive patients, 60 received BR (43 with relapsed/refractory WM) and 100 received DRC (50 had relapsed/refractory WM). In the treatment-naive setting, overall response rate (ORR) was 93% with BR versus 96% with DRC (p = 0.55). Two-year progression-free survival (PFS) with BR and DRC was 88 and 61%, respectively (p = 0.07). In salvage setting, ORR was 95% with BR versus 87% with DRC, p = 0.45; median PFS with BR was 58 versus 32 months with DRC (2-year PFS was 66 versus 53%; p = 0.08). Median disease-specific survival was not reached with BR versus 166 months with DRC (p = 0.51). The time-to-event endpoints and depth of response were independent of the MYD88 mutation status. Grade >= 3 adverse events of both regimens were comparable. A trend for longer PFS was observed with BR although the regimens have comparable toxicities. The activity of BR and DRC appears to be unaffected by patients' MYD88 mutation status.|Non-Cancer
ID:29627788|Title:Treatment of hemorrhagic head and neck lesions by direct puncture and n-BCA embolization.Abstract:Life-threatening bleeding in the head and neck region requires urgent management. These hemorrhagic lesions, for example, a ruptured pseudoaneurysm, are often treated by transarterial embolization (TAE), but prior intervention or surgery, inflammation, anatomic variants, and vessel tortuosity may render an endovascular approach challenging, time-consuming, and sometimes impossible. We report two cases of severe head and neck hemorrhages successfully embolized with n-butyl cyanoacrylate via direct puncture, and propose this approach as a fast, safe, and effective alternative to TAE.|Non-Cancer
ID:29653965|Title:Patients with CD3G mutations reveal a role for human CD3gamma in Treg diversity and suppressive function.Abstract:Integrity of the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex is crucial for positive and negative selection of T cells in the thymus and for effector and regulatory functions of peripheral T lymphocytes. In humans, CD3D, CD3E, and CD3Z gene defects are a cause of severe immune deficiency and present early in life with increased susceptibility to infections. By contrast, CD3G mutations lead to milder phenotypes, mainly characterized by autoimmunity. However, the role of CD3gamma in establishing and maintaining immune tolerance has not been elucidated. In this manuscript, we aimed to investigate abnormalities of T-cell repertoire and function in patients with genetic defects in CD3G associated with autoimmunity. High throughput sequencing was used to study composition and diversity of the T-cell receptor beta (TRB) repertoire in regulatory T cells (Tregs), conventional CD4+ (Tconv), and CD8+ T cells from 6 patients with CD3G mutations and healthy controls. Treg function was assessed by studying its ability to suppress proliferation of Tconv cells. Treg cells of patients with CD3G defects had reduced diversity, increased clonality, and reduced suppressive function. The TRB repertoire of Tconv cells from patients with CD3G deficiency was enriched for hydrophobic amino acids at positions 6 and 7 of the CDR3, a biomarker of self-reactivity. These data demonstrate that the T-cell repertoire of patients with CD3G mutations is characterized by a molecular signature that may contribute to the increased rate of autoimmunity associated with this condition.|Non-Cancer

ID:29712894|Title:Increased proteasomal activity supports photoreceptor survival in inherited retinal degeneration.Abstract:Inherited retinal degenerations, affecting more than 2 million people worldwide, are caused by mutations in over 200 genes. This suggests that the most efficient therapeutic strategies would be mutation independent, i.e., targeting common pathological conditions arising from many disease-causing mutations. Previous studies revealed that one such condition is an insufficiency of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to process misfolded or mistargeted proteins in affected photoreceptor cells. We now report that retinal degeneration in mice can be significantly delayed by increasing photoreceptor proteasomal activity. The largest effect is observed upon overexpression of the 11S proteasome cap subunit, PA28alpha, which enhanced ubiquitin-independent protein degradation in photoreceptors. Applying this strategy to mice bearing one copy of the P23H rhodopsin mutant, a mutation frequently encountered in human patients, quadruples the number of surviving photoreceptors in the inferior retina of 6-month-old mice. This striking therapeutic effect demonstrates that proteasomes are an attractive target for fighting inherited blindness.|Non-Cancer
ID:29728376|Title:Reconciling newborn screening and a novel splice variant in BTD associated with partial biotinidase deficiency: a BabySeq Project case report.Abstract:Here, we report a newborn female infant from the well-baby cohort of the BabySeq Project who was identified with compound heterozygous BTD gene variants. The two identified variants included a well-established pathogenic variant (c.1612C>T, p.Arg538Cys) that causes profound biotinidase deficiency (BTD) in homozygosity. In addition, a novel splice variant (c.44+1G>A, p.?) was identified in the invariant splice donor region of intron 1, potentially predictive of loss of function. The novel variant was predicted to impact splicing of exon 1; however, given the absence of any reported pathogenic variants in exon 1 and the presence of alternative splicing with exon 1 absent in most tissues in the GTEx database, we assigned an initial classification of uncertain significance. Follow-up medical record review of state-mandated newborn screen (NBS) results revealed an initial out-of-range biotinidase activity level. Levels from a repeat NBS sample barely passed cutoff into the normal range. To determine whether the infant was biotinidase-deficient, subsequent diagnostic enzyme activity testing was performed, confirming partial BTD, and resulted in a change of management for this patient. This led to reclassification of the novel splice variant based on these results. In conclusion, combining the genetic and NBS results together prompted clinical follow-up that confirmed partial BTD and informed this novel splice site's reclassification, emphasizing the importance of combining iterative genetic and phenotypic evaluations.|Non-Cancer
ID:29728436|Title:Splenic cyst and its management in a 21-month-old boy: a rare complication of invasive meningococcal disease.Abstract:Splenic complications of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) are well recognised, though cyst formation is rare, particularly in paediatric populations. The best approach to their management is not yet established. This case outlines the management of a splenic cyst in a 21-month-old boy following severe IMD. The case took place in the context of an acute emergence of serogroup W prompting significant media attention and subsequent change in vaccination practice at a jurisdictional level in Australia. The patient was critically unwell early in the illness, then later a collection in the left upper quadrant was detected, shown on ultrasound to be a 11.6x7.7 cm splenic cyst. In this case, the cyst was managed by ultrasound-guided drainage tube insertion. The residual collection was small and stable on subsequent imaging.|Non-Cancer
ID:29760532|Title:Apoptotic cell-induced AhR activity is required for immunological tolerance and suppression of systemic lupus erythematosus in mice and humans.Abstract:The transcription factor AhR modulates immunity at multiple levels. Here we report that phagocytes exposed to apoptotic cells exhibited rapid activation of AhR, which drove production of the cytokine IL-10. Activation of AhR was dependent on interactions between apoptotic-cell DNA and the pattern-recognition receptor TLR9 that was required for the prevention of immune responses to DNA and histones in vivo. Moreover, disease progression in mouse systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) correlated with strength of the AhR signal, and the disease course could be altered by modulation of AhR activity. Deletion of AhR in the myeloid lineage caused systemic autoimmunity in mice, and an enhanced AhR transcriptional signature correlated with disease in patients with SLE. Thus, AhR activity induced by apoptotic cell phagocytes maintains peripheral tolerance.|Non-Cancer
ID:29775646|Title:The RNA binding protein Ars2 supports hematopoiesis at multiple levels.Abstract:Recent biochemical characterization of arsenic resistance protein 2 (Ars2) has established it as central in determining the fate of nascent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase II (RNAPII) transcripts. Through interactions with the nuclear 5'-7-methylguanosine cap-binding complex, Ars2 promotes cotranscriptional processing coupled with nuclear export or degradation of several classes of RNAPII transcripts, allowing for gene expression programs that facilitate rapid and sustained proliferation of immortalized cells in culture. However, rapidly dividing cells in culture do not represent the physiological condition of the vast majority of cells in an adult mammal. To examine functions of Ars2 in a physiological setting, we generated inducible Ars2 knockout mice and found that deletion of Ars2 from adult mice resulted in defective hematopoiesis in bone marrow and thymus. Importantly, only some of this defect could be explained by the requirement of Ars2 for rapid proliferation, which we found to be cell-type specific in vivo. Rather, Ars2 was required for survival of developing thymocytes and for limiting differentiation of bone marrow resident long-term hematopoietic stem cells. As a result, Ars2 knockout led to rapid thymic involution and loss of the ability of mice to regenerate peripheral blood after myeloablation. These in vivo data demonstrate that Ars2 expression is important at several steps of hematopoiesis, likely because Ars2 acts on gene expression programs underlying essential cell fate decisions such as the decision to die,proliferate, or differentiate.|Non-Cancer
ID:29781571|Title:New approach to accurate interpretation of sickle cell disease newborn screening by applying multiple of median cutoffs and ratios.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The main goal of newborn screening (NBS) for sickle cell disease (SCD) is to detect affected neonates so that specific preventive care can be implemented. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) used for NBS has high sensitivity and specificity, but we lack guidelines for quantitative hemoglobin (Hb) fraction interpretation. The purpose of this study was to determine cutoff values to standardize quantitative interpretation in SCD NBS for different clinical situation such as, red blood cell transfusion or beta-thalassemia, which can be real screening pitfalls. METHODS: Retrospective study of 75,026 samples from the neonatal screening program analyzed in our laboratory. Precise HbA and HbS percentages at birth were recorded and median values established for each gestational age, allowing percentage results to be expressed in normal gestation-specific multiples of the median (MoM). Three threshold values of clinical interest were determined. RESULTS: High levels of HbA (>2.5 MoM) allowed identification of newborns who received transfusions. Low levels of HbS (<=0.7 MoM) allowed detection of the association between HbS and other mutations of the beta-globin gene (i.e., HbHope, beta0-thalassemia, etc.). An HbA/HbS ratio <0.5 to distinguish healthy carriers from SCD with S/beta+-thalassemia. The screening accuracy for each threshold was established. The screening accuracy of low-level HbA, which is determinant in identifying the subgroup of patients at risk of beta-thalassemia, will be determined prospectively. CONCLUSIONS: This new approach introduces tools for a quantitative interpretation in SCD NBS by HPLC methods and could allow standardization of interpretation between centers.|Non-Cancer

We identified an unclassified IGF1RR1353H variant in a male with extreme tall height, very low levels of serum IGF-I and delayed and prolonged growth spurt. The index case's mother and three sons all carried the variant, but so far only the eldest son (age 18 years) presented with tall height. We hypothesized that the variant could constitute an activating mutation. DESIGN: The IGF1RR1353H variant was investigated in Igf1r-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (R-cells) by cell cycle, colony formation and transcriptome analyses. RESULTS: The IGF1RR1353H (R-1353) exhibited significantly increased cell proliferation, G1-S progression and colony formation in soft agar. RNA sequencing identified 195 differentially expressed genes between R-WT and R-1353 (adjusted P < 1E-100). Most genes were upregulated in R-1353, including the gene encoding the androgen receptor (AR). Gene expression profiling showed the most significant enrichment in extracellular matrix organization (P = 2.76E-7), collagen biosynthesis (P = 1.21E-5) and cell adhesion (P = 7.38E-5). Retrospective biochemical analysis of the index case revealed decreased testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin levels, whereas LH and FSH were within normal ranges. This profile suggests an increased sensitivity to androgen, which is compatible with the enhanced expression of Ar in R-1353 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that R1353H constitutes an activating IGF1R variant. The possible deregulation of collagen turnover and increased androgen sensitivity implicates an association to tall phenotype in male carriers.|Non-Cancer
ID:29794022|Title:YAP Controls Endothelial Activation and Vascular Inflammation Through TRAF6.Abstract:RATIONALE: Microvascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction secondary to unchecked activation of endothelium play a critical role in the pathophysiology of sepsis and organ failure. The intrinsic signaling mechanisms responsible for dampening excessive activation of endothelial cells are not completely understood. OBJECTIVE: To determine the central role of YAP (Yes-associated protein), the major transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo pathway, in modulating the strength and magnitude of endothelial activation and vascular inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endothelial-specific YAP knockout mice showed increased basal expression of E-selectin and ICAM (intercellular adhesion molecule)-1 in endothelial cells, a greater number of adherent neutrophils in postcapillary venules and increased neutrophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Lipopolysaccharide challenge of these mice augmented NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB) activation, expression of endothelial adhesion proteins, neutrophil and monocyte adhesion to cremaster muscle venules, transendothelial neutrophil migration, and lung inflammatory injury. Deletion of YAP in endothelial cells also markedly augmented the inflammatory response and cardiovascular dysfunction in a polymicrobial sepsis model induced by cecal ligation and puncture. YAP functioned by interacting with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TLR (Toll-like receptor) signaling adaptor TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6) to ubiquitinate TRAF6, and thus promoted TRAF6 degradation and modification resulting in inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. TRAF6 depletion in endothelial cells rescued the augmented inflammatory phenotype in mice with endothelial cell-specific deletion of YAP. CONCLUSIONS: YAP modulates the activation of endothelial cells and suppresses vascular inflammation through preventing TRAF6-mediated NF-kappaB activation and is hence essential for limiting the severity of sepsis-induced inflammation and organ failure.|Non-Cancer
ID:29804876|Title:Distant Insulin Signaling Regulates Vertebrate Pigmentation through the Sheddase Bace2.Abstract:Patterning of vertebrate melanophores is essential for mate selection and protection from UV-induced damage. Patterning can be influenced by circulating long-range factors, such as hormones, but it is unclear how their activity is controlled in recipient cells to prevent excesses in cell number and migration. The zebrafish wanderlust mutant harbors a mutation in the sheddase bace2 and exhibits hyperdendritic and hyperproliferative melanophores that localize to aberrant sites. We performed a chemical screen to identify suppressors of the wanderlust phenotype and found that inhibition of insulin/PI3Kgamma/mTOR signaling rescues the defect. In normal physiology, Bace2 cleaves the insulin receptor, whereas its loss results in hyperactive insulin/PI3K/mTOR signaling. Insulin B, an isoform enriched in the head, drives the melanophore defect. These results suggest that insulin signaling is negatively regulated by melanophore-specific expression of a sheddase, highlighting how long-distance factors can be regulated in a cell-type-specific manner.|Non-Cancer
ID:29855039|Title:Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia: clinical and molecular review.Abstract:Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (HED) is a genetic human disorder which affects structures of ectodermal origin. Although there are autosomal recessive and dominant forms, X-linked (XL) is the most frequent form of the disease. This XL-HED phenotype is associated with mutations in the gene encoding the transmembrane protein ectodysplasin-1 (EDA1), a member of the TNFalpha-related signaling pathway. The proteins from this pathway are involved in signal transduction from ectoderm to mesenchyme leading to the development of ectoderm-derived structures in the fetus such as hair, teeth, skin, nails, and eccrine sweat glands. The aim of this review was to update the main clinical characteristics of HED regarding to recent molecular advances in the comprehension of all the possible genes involved in this group of disorders since it is known that Eda-A1-Edar signaling has multiple roles in ectodermal organ development, regulating their initiation, morphogenesis, and differentiation steps. The knowledge of the biological mechanisms that generate HED is needed for both a better detection of possible cases and for the design of efficient prevention and treatment approaches.|Non-Cancer
ID:29856837|Title:Eltrombopag versus romiplostim in treatment of adult patients with immune thrombocytopenia: A systematic review incorporating an indirect-comparison meta-analysis.Abstract:PURPOSE: In absence of direct comparison randomized controlled trials (RCTs), indirect comparison was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) in treatment of adult immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials.gov, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database from their earliest records to May 2017. RCTs comparing the TPO-RAs with placebo in adult ITP were included. Primary outcomes were the overall response rate. Secondary outcomes included safety, durable response, overall or clinically significant bleeding, and the proportion of patients receiving rescue medication. RESULTS: Nine randomized placebo-controlled trials (786 participants) were included in this systematic review. Overall response [Risk Ratio(RR) = 0.59, 95%Confidence Interval(CI): 0.24-1.45], the incidence of adverse events (RR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.79-1.21), durable response (RR = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.08-2.81), the incidence of overall bleeding (RR = 1.15, 95%CI: 0.52-2.57) and clinically significant bleeding (RR = 1.09, 95%CI: 0.37-3.24), and the proportion of patients receiving rescue treatment (RR = 0.95, 95%CI: 0.47-1.90) were similar between eltrombopag and romiplostim. CONCLUSIONS: Eltrombopag and romiplostim might be equivalent in efficacy and safety for adult ITP, however, physicians should still take into account drug cost and comorbidities of the specific patient while making decisions on the treatment of ITP with TPO-RAs.

ID:29884702|Title:mTOR Complex 1 Signaling Regulates the Generation and Function of Central and Effector Foxp3+ Regulatory T Cells.Abstract:The mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has emerged as a critical integrator of signals from the immune microenvironment capable of regulating T cell activation, differentiation, and function. The precise role of mTOR in the control of regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation and function is complex. Pharmacologic inhibition and genetic deletion of mTOR promotes the generation of Tregs even under conditions that would normally promote generation of effector T cells. Alternatively, mTOR activity has been observed to be increased in Tregs, and the genetic deletion of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-scaffold protein Raptor inhibits Treg function. In this study, by employing both pharmacologic inhibitors and genetically altered T cells, we seek to clarify the role of mTOR in Tregs. Our studies demonstrate that inhibition of mTOR during T cell activation promotes the generation of long-lived central Tregs with a memory-like phenotype in mice. Metabolically, these central memory Tregs possess enhanced spare respiratory capacity, similar to CD8+ memory cells. Alternatively, the generation of effector Tregs (eTregs) requires mTOR function. Indeed, genetic deletion of Rptor leads to the decreased expression of ICOS and PD-1 on the eTregs. Overall, our studies define a subset of mTORC1hi eTregs and mTORC1lo central Tregs.|Non-Cancer
ID:29885404|Title:In situ analysis of mTORC1/2 and cellular metabolism-related proteins in human Lymphangioleiomyomatosis.Abstract:Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare progressive cystic lung disease with features of a low-grade neoplasm. It is primarily caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 genes. Sirolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), slows down disease progression in some, but not all patients. Hitherto, other potential therapeutic targets such as mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and various metabolic pathways have not been investigated in human LAM tissues. The aim of this study was to assess activities of mTORC1, mTORC2 and various metabolic pathways in human LAM tissues through analysis of protein expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of p-S6 (mTORC1 downstream protein), Rictor (mTORC2 scaffold protein) as well as GLUT1, GAPDH, ATPB, GLS, MCT1, ACSS2 and CPT1A (metabolic pathway markers) were performed on lung tissue from 11 patients with sporadic LAM. Immunoreactivity was assessed in LAM cells with bronchial smooth muscle cells as controls. Expression of p-S6, Rictor, GAPDH, GLS, MCT1, ACSS2 and CPT1A was significantly higher in LAM cells than in bronchial smooth muscle cells (P<.01). No significant differences were found between LAM cells and normal bronchial smooth muscle cells in GLUT1 and ATPB expression. The results are uniquely derived from human tissue and indicate that, in addition to mTORC1, mTORC2 may also play an important role in the pathobiology of LAM. Furthermore, glutaminolysis, acetate utilization and fatty acid beta-oxidation appear to be the preferred bioenergetic pathways in LAM cells. mTORC2 and these preferred bioenergetic pathways appear worthy of further study as they may represent possible therapeutic targets in the treatment of LAM.|Non-Cancer
ID:29915580|Title:CD8+HLADR+ Regulatory T Cells Change With Aging: They Increase in Number, but Lose Checkpoint Inhibitory Molecules and Suppressive Function.Abstract:CD4+ regulatory T cells have been intensively studied during aging, but little is still known about age-related changes of other regulatory T cell subsets. It was, therefore, the goal of the present study to analyze CD8+human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related (HLADR)+ T cells in old age, a cell population reported to have suppressive activity and to be connected to specific genetic variants. We demonstrate a strong increase in the number of CD8+HLADR+ T cells with age in a cohort of female Sardinians as well as in elderly male and female persons from Austria. We also show that CD8+HLADR+ T cells lack classical activation molecules, such as CD69 and CD25, but contain increased numbers of checkpoint inhibitory molecules, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, T cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein-3, LAG-3, and PD-1, when compared with their HLADR- counterparts. They also have the capacity to inhibit the proliferation of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This suppressive activity is, however, decreased when CD8+HLADR+ T cells from elderly persons are analyzed. In accordance with this finding, CD8+HLADR+ T cells from persons of old age contain lower percentages of checkpoint inhibitory molecules than young controls. We conclude that in spite of high abundance of a CD8+ regulatory T cell subset in old age its expression of checkpoint inhibitory molecules and its suppressive function on a per cell basis are reduced. Reduction of suppressive capacity may support uncontrolled subclinical inflammatory processes referred to as "inflamm-aging."|Non-Cancer
ID:29929111|Title:Calcification in cerebral parenchyma affects pharmacoresistant epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis.Abstract:PURPOSE: Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene and results in the over-activation of the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, is clinically used to treat hamartomatous lesionsas in TSC and its effect on controlling epilepsy is also reported in many studies. This study aims to evaluate the risk factors of pharmacoresistant epilepsy in patients with TSC receiving long-term rapamycin treatment. METHOD: A total of 108 patients with TSC taking rapamycin for over 1 year were enrolled in this study. Factors that might influence seizure control were statistically analyzed by multiple factor analysis. A subgroup analysis was also conducted to access the relationship between calcified epileptic foci and pharmacoresistant epilepsy. (Clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR-OOB-15006535(2015-05-29)). RESULTS: Seizure was controlled in 53 patients but was not managed in 55 patients considered to be drug resistant. Logistic regression analysis showed that calcification in the cerebral parenchyma was a risk factor of pharmacoresistant epilepsy [P = 0.006, odds ratio (OR) = 4.831 (1.577, 14.795)]. Fifteen of 17 patients with calcified epileptic foci suffered from pharmacoresistant epilepsy (88.2%). Seizures in patients with calcified epileptic foci were probably pharmacoresistant (P = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Calcification in epileptic foci strongly indicates pharmacoresistant epilepsy in patients with TSC even when treated with appropriate anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) and rapamycin. Calcification can be used to evaluate pharmacoresistant epilepsy in patients with TSC.|Non-Cancer
ID:29930110|Title:Analysis of shared heritability in common disorders of the brain.Abstract:Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.|Non-Cancer
ID:29945600|Title:Membrane-bound and soluble forms of an NMDA receptor extracellular domain retain epitopes targeted in auto-immune encephalitis.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (ANRE) is a potentially lethal disease attributed to auto-antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Full recovery is possible if therapy is initiated early in the disease course. Detection of ANRE antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is essential for diagnosis. The assays for ANRE-associated IgGs often rely on cells transiently transfected with NMDAR genes. A cell line that stably expresses pathogenic NMDAR epitopes could improve standardization of the assays and provide antigen that could be used in commercial solid state assay systems. RESULTS: We expressed the amino terminal domain (ATD) of the GluN1 NMDAR subunit (NR1) as a fusion protein on the outer plasma membrane of 293T cells, creating a stable cell population (293T-ATD) that is recognized by ANRE patient monoclonal antibodies in flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assays. The ATD fusion protein also contains a Myc tag and a 6XHIS tag, which provide functionality for immunoassays and antigen purification, and a TEV protease site, which allows the ATD domain to be specifically released from the cells in essentially pure form. ATD mobilized from the 293T ATD cell line maintained the pathogenic ANRE epitopes in ELISA binding assays. CSF (3/4) and sera (4/4) from ANRE patients also bound the 293T-ATD cell line, whereas normal CSF and sera did not. CONCLUSIONS: The 293T-ATD cell line is potentially adaptable to a variety of formats to identify antibodies associated with ANRE, including cell-based and soluble antigen formats, and demonstrates a useful method to produce complex proteins for research, drug discovery, and clinical diagnosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:29948574|Title:T+ NK+ IL-2 Receptor gamma Chain Mutation: a Challenging Diagnosis of Atypical Severe Combined Immunodeficiency.Abstract:PURPOSE: All reported patients with hypomorphic X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) due to c.664C>T (p.R222C) mutations in the gene (IL2RG) encoding the common gamma chain (gammac) have presented with opportunistic infections within the first year of life, despite the presence of nearly normal NK and T cell numbers. Reporting five children of one extended family with hemizygous mutations in IL2RG, we explore potential diagnostic clues and extend our comprehension of the functional impact of this mutation. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES); detailed immune phenotyping; cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation; B, T, and NK cell activation; and quantification of sjTRECs in five Arab children with c.664C>T (p.R222C) IL2RG mutation. RESULTS: The mean age at clinical presentation with respiratory tract infection or diarrhea was 6.8 (range: 2-12) months. None of the children presented with opportunistic infections. Diagnostic clues were early onset in the first year of life, and a suggestive family history associated with reduced naive CD4 T cells and absent switched memory B cells. Number and phenotype of NK cells and innate-like lymphocytes were normal. The diagnosis was made by WES and corroborated by absent STAT phosphorylation and reduced functional response after IL-2 and IL-21 stimulation. Four patients underwent successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: As early diagnosis and treatment are important, a high index of suspicion in the diagnosis of c.664C>T (p.R222C) X-SCID is needed. This requires prompt genetic testing by next generation sequencing in order to avoid unnecessary delays in the definite diagnosis since immunological work up may not be discriminating. Assays directly testing cytokine signaling or cytokine-dependent functions are helpful in confirming the functional impact of the identified hypomorphic variants.|Non-Cancer

ID:29969437|Title:Inherited p40phox deficiency differs from classic chronic granulomatous disease.Abstract:Biallelic loss-of-function (LOF) mutations of the NCF4 gene, encoding the p40phox subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, have been described in only 1 patient. We report on 24 p40phox-deficient patients from 12 additional families in 8 countries. These patients display 8 different in-frame or out-of-frame mutations of NCF4 that are homozygous in 11 of the families and compound heterozygous in another. When overexpressed in NB4 neutrophil-like cells and EBV-transformed B cells in vitro, the mutant alleles were found to be LOF, with the exception of the p.R58C and c.120_134del alleles, which were hypomorphic. Particle-induced NADPH oxidase activity was severely impaired in the patients' neutrophils, whereas PMA-induced dihydrorhodamine-1,2,3 (DHR) oxidation, which is widely used as a diagnostic test for chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), was normal or mildly impaired in the patients. Moreover, the NADPH oxidase activity of EBV-transformed B cells was also severely impaired, whereas that of mononuclear phagocytes was normal. Finally, the killing of Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae by neutrophils was conserved in these patients, unlike in patients with CGD. The patients suffer from hyperinflammation and peripheral infections, but they do not have any of the invasive bacterial or fungal infections seen in CGD. Inherited p40phox deficiency underlies a distinctive condition, resembling a mild, atypical form of CGD.|Non-Cancer
ID:29973720|Title:Mechanism for remodelling of the cell cycle checkpoint protein MAD2 by the ATPase TRIP13.Abstract:The maintenance of genome stability during mitosis is coordinated by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) through its effector the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), an inhibitor of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C, also known as the cyclosome)1,2. Unattached kinetochores control MCC assembly by catalysing a change in the topology of the beta-sheet of MAD2 (an MCC subunit), thereby generating the active closed MAD2 (C-MAD2) conformer3-5. Disassembly of free MCC, which is required for SAC inactivation and chromosome segregation, is an ATP-dependent process driven by the AAA+ ATPase TRIP13. In combination with p31comet, an SAC antagonist6, TRIP13 remodels C-MAD2 into inactive open MAD2 (O-MAD2)7-10. Here, we present a mechanism that explains how TRIP13-p31comet disassembles the MCC. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the TRIP13-p31comet-C-MAD2-CDC20 complex reveal that p31comet recruits C-MAD2 to a defined site on the TRIP13 hexameric ring, positioning the N terminus of C-MAD2 (MAD2NT) to insert into the axial pore of TRIP13 and distorting the TRIP13 ring to initiate remodelling. Molecular modelling suggests that by gripping MAD2NT within its axial pore, TRIP13 couples sequential ATP-driven translocation of its hexameric ring along MAD2NT to push upwards on, and simultaneously rotate, the globular domains of the p31comet-C-MAD2 complex. This unwinds a region of the alphaA helix of C-MAD2 that is required to stabilize the C-MAD2 beta-sheet, thus destabilizing C-MAD2 in favour of O-MAD2 and dissociating MAD2 from p31comet. Our study provides insights into how specific substrates are recruited to AAA+ ATPases through adaptor proteins and suggests a model of how translocation through the axial pore of AAA+ ATPases is coupled to protein remodelling.|Non-Cancer

This study evaluates in detail the molecular pathology of type-3 VWD in India. One hundred and two patients from 90 families were evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Phenotypic data, including bleeding scores (BS), were documented using structured questionnaires. Diagnosis of type 3 VWD was based on undetectable VWF antigen levels in the plasma. Genomic DNA from these patients was screened for mutations in VWF gene. Structural modeling and expression studies were carried out for missense mutations. RESULTS: Out of 102 patients, mutations could be identified in 91% (n = 93). Fifty-five different gene variants were identified. Thirty-four (61.8%) were novel. Mutations could be identified in both the alleles in 90 patients, while no causative mutation could be identified in 9 patients; twenty-four (23.5%) patients had mutations clustered in the propeptide region of VWF. Interestingly, five mutations accounted for the defects in 37/93 (39.8%) patients. Structural analysis and in vitro studies on missense mutations imply impaired processes associated with secretion of VWF. CONCLUSION: This study is one of the largest series to define the molecular basis of type-3 VWD.|Non-Cancer
ID:30007456|Title:Cutaneous Mastocytosis in Adults and Children: New Classification and Prognostic Factors.Abstract:The skin is one of the most frequent tissues affected in patients with mastocytosis, but cutaneous lesions are highly heterogeneous in shape, size, color, number, localization, and distribution. The World Health Organization recognizes 3 subtypes of cutaneous mastocytosis (CM): maculopapular CM (MPCM), diffuse CM, and mastocytoma of skin. An international task force of experts in mastocytosis has recently proposed subdividing MPCM into monomorphic and polymorphic, which could predict the duration of the disease in children. More research is warranted to develop an improved classification of CM that ideally should incorporate robust factors with prognostic impact on disease behavior.|Non-Cancer
ID:30007458|Title:Bone Marrow Expression of Mast Cell Disorders.Abstract:Mast cell disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of rare diseases, the diagnosis of which still remains a challenge. Bone marrow analysis constitutes the most appropriate site for screening systemic involvement in mastocytosis. Morphologic, immunohistochemical, flow cytometric immunophenotyping, and molecular studies should be routinely performed for diagnostic/prognostic purposes in experienced reference centers during the diagnostic workup in suspected systemic mastocytosis. The authors review the most relevant characteristics of bone marrow expression of mast cell disorders as well as the different methodological approaches to be applied to perform an objective and reproducible diagnosis and classification of mastocytosis and other mast cell disorders.|Non-Cancer
ID:30009677|Title:Generation of CD34 Fluorescent Reporter Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for Monitoring Hematopoietic Differentiation.Abstract:Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold great promise for disease modeling, drug screens, and eventually cell therapy approaches. During in vitro differentiation of hiPSCs into hematoendothelial progenitors, the emergence of CD34-positive cells indicates a critical step of lineage specification. To facilitate the monitoring of hematopoietic differentiation of hiPSCs, we established fluorescent reporter cells for the stem and progenitor cell marker CD34. An IRES-GFP (internal ribosome entry site green fluorescent protein) construct was introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 into the 3' untranslated region of one endogenous CD34 allele. Single-cell clones were generated after excision of the floxed puromycin resistance cassette by Cre recombination and correct insertion was confirmed by genotyping polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot. To validate their functionality, the reporter hiPSCs were in vitro differentiated toward CD34+ cells using the STEMdiff Hematopoietic Kit combined with short-term inhibition of GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3). All cells expressing nuclear GFP were positive for cell surface CD34, thus allowing the direct monitoring of the differentiation of hiPSCs into CD34+ cells either by flow cytometry or confocal microscopy. After fluorescence-activated cell sorting, cells displaying high GFP expression exhibited increased colony-forming potential in the MethoCult colony-forming unit assays as compared with CD34+ cells obtained by magnetic-activated cell sorting. In summary, we have generated functional CD34 GFP reporter hiPSCs, which not only permit label-free separation of HSPCs, but also tracing of the emergence and fate of CD34+ progenitors at the single-cell level.|Non-Cancer
ID:30051161|Title:Toxoplasma gondii chromosomal passenger complex is essential for the organization of a functional mitotic spindle: a prerequisite for productive endodyogeny.Abstract:The phylum Apicomplexa encompasses deadly pathogens such as malaria and Cryptosporidium. Apicomplexa cell division is mechanistically divergent from that of their mammalian host, potentially representing an attractive source of drug targets. Depending on the species, apicomplexan parasites can modulate the output of cell division, producing two to thousands of daughter cells at once. The inherent flexibility of their cell division mechanisms allows these parasites to adapt to different niches, facilitating their dissemination. Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites divide using a unique form of cell division called endodyogeny. This process involves a single round of DNA replication, closed nuclear mitosis, and assembly of two daughter cells within a mother. In higher Eukaryotes, the four-subunit chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) (Aurora kinase B (ARKB)/INCENP/Borealin/Survivin) promotes chromosome bi-orientation by detaching incorrect kinetochore-microtubule attachments, playing an essential role in controlling cell division fidelity. Herein, we report the characterization of the Toxoplasma CPC (Aurora kinase 1 (Ark1)/INCENP1/INCENP2). We show that the CPC exhibits dynamic localization in a cell cycle-dependent manner. TgArk1 interacts with both TgINCENPs, with TgINCENP2 being essential for its translocation to the nucleus. While TgINCENP1 appears to be dispensable, interfering with TgArk1 or TgINCENP2 results in pronounced division and growth defects. Significant anti-cancer drug development efforts have focused on targeting human ARKB. Parasite treatment with low doses of hesperadin, a known inhibitor of human ARKB at higher concentrations, phenocopies the TgArk1 and TgINCENP2 mutants. Overall, our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underpinning cell cycle control in Apicomplexa, and highlights TgArk1 as potential drug target.|Non-Cancer
ID:30065290|Title:Myelofibrosis Treatment Algorithm 2018.Abstract:Two novel prognostic systems for primary myelofibrosis (PMF) were recently unveiled: GIPSS (genetically inspired prognostic scoring system) and MIPSS70 (mutation-enhanced international prognostic scoring system for transplant-age patients). GIPSS is based exclusively on genetic markers: mutations and karyotype. MIPSS70 includes mutations and clinical risk factors. In its most recent adaptation, the prognostic value of MIPSS70 has been bolstered by the inclusion of a three-tiered cytogenetic risk stratification and use of hemoglobin thresholds that are adjusted for sex and severity (MIPSS70+ version 2.0). GIPSS features four, MIPSS70 three, and MIPSS70+ version 2.0 five risk categories. MIPSS70 is most useful in the absence of cytogenetic information. MIPSS70+ version 2.0 is more comprehensive than MIPSS70 and is the preferred model in the presence of cytogenetic information. Both MIPSS70 and MIPSS70+ version 2.0 require an online score calculator ( http://www.mipss70score.it ). GIPPS offers a lower complexity prognostic tool that reliably identifies candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplant (GIPSS high-risk disease) or long-term observation with little or no therapeutic intervention (GIPSS low-risk disease). Ultimately, we favor a step-wise prognostication approach that starts with GIPSS but also considers MIPSS70+ version 2.0 for confirming the most appropriate treatment approach for the individual patient.|Non-Cancer
ID:30085095|Title:Bioengineered PBGD variant improves the therapeutic index of gene therapy vectors for acute intermittent porphyria.Abstract:A first-in-human gene therapy trial using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector for acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) reveals that higher doses would be required to reach therapeutic levels of the porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) transgene. We developed a hyperfunctional PBGD protein to improve the therapeutic index without increasing vector dose. A consensus protein sequence from 12 mammal species was compared to the human PBGD sequence, and eight amino acids were selected. I291M and N340S variants showed the highest increase in enzymatic activity when expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. In silico analysis indicates that isoleucine 291 to methionine and asparagine 340 to serine variants did not affect the active site of the enzyme. In vitro analysis indicated a synergistic interaction between these two substitutions that improve kinetic stability. Finally, full protection against a phenobarbital-induced attack was achieved in AIP mice after the administration of 1 x 1011 gc/kg of rAAV2/8-PBGD-I291M/N340S vector; three times lower than the dose required to achieve full protection with the control rAAV2/8-hPBGD vector. In conclusion, we have developed and characterized a hyperfunctional PBGD protein. The inclusion of this variant sequence in a rAAV2/8 vector allows the effective dose to be lowered in AIP mice.|Non-Cancer
ID:30092282|Title:RNA binding protein HuR regulates extracellular matrix gene expression and pH homeostasis independent of controlling HIF-1alpha signaling in nucleus pulposus cells.Abstract:Nucleus pulposus (NP) cells reside in the hypoxic niche of the intervertebral disc. Studies have demonstrated that RNA-binding protein HuR modulates hypoxic signaling in several cancers, however, its function in the disc is unknown. HuR did not show cytoplasmic translocation in hypoxia and its silencing did not alter levels of Hif-1alpha or HIF-targets in NP cells. RNA-Sequencing data revealed that important extracellular matrix-related genes including several collagens, MMPs, aggrecan, Tgf-beta3 and Sdc4 were regulated by HuR. Further analysis of HuR-silenced NP cells confirmed that HuR maintained expression of these matrix genes. We confirmed decreased levels of secreted collagen I and Sdc4 and increased pro-MMP13 in HuR-knockdown cells. In addition, messenger ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation demonstrated HuR binding to Tgf-beta3 and Sdc4 mRNAs. Interestingly, while HuR bound to Hif-1alpha and Vegf mRNAs, it was clear that compensatory mechanisms sustained their expression when HuR was silenced. Noteworthy, despite the presence of multiple HuR-binding sites and reported interaction in other cell types, HuR showed no binding to Pgk1, Eno1, Pdk1 and Pfkfb3 in NP cells. Metabolic studies showed a significant decrease in the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and acidic pH in HuR-silenced NP cells, without appreciable change in total OCR. These changes were likely due to decreased Ca12 expression in HuR silenced cells. Taken together, our study demonstrates for the first time that HuR regulates extracellular matrix (ECM) and pH homeostasis of NP cells and has important implications in the maintenance of intervertebral disc health.|Non-Cancer
ID:30098008|Title:Everolimus in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex-related West syndrome: First results from a single-center prospective observational study.Abstract:Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is the most common cause of West syndrome (WS). Currently available treatment options are ineffective in the majority of affected infants and/or associated with potential serious side effects. Based on the assumption that mTOR overactivation results in increased neuroexcitability in TSC, mTOR inhibitors have been studied as antiseizure therapy. As a result, everolimus recently received approval for the adjunctive treatment of patients aged >=2 years with refractory TSC-associated focal and secondary generalized seizures. However, efficacy and safety data for infants with TSC-associated WS are still lacking. Therefore, a prospective open-label observational study was initiated at our center, to evaluate everolimus add-on treatment in infants with TSC-associated WS, previously refractory to standard treatment. For this preliminary report, data from four male infants with TSC2 and a median observation period of 13 (range = 8-42) months after treatment initiation were analyzed. Two infants showed electroclinical remission until day 14 after everolimus treatment initiation. In one additional infant, hypsarrhythmia resolved. No relapse after initial response was documented. Developmental progress improved in three infants. Tolerability was similar to that described in older children. According to our preliminary results, everolimus appears to have the potential to treat successfully both spasms and hypsarrhythmia in infants with TSC-associated WS, contributing to better developmental progress.|Non-Cancer
ID:30115720|Title:Tension haemothorax from a bleeding branch of the renal artery following isolated penetrating thoracic trauma: a rare presentation.Abstract:A 27-year-old man presented to a major trauma centre with two posterolateral thoracic stab injuries over the right scapula and thoracoabdominal junction. He was tachycardic and hypotensive with a chest X-ray revealing a large right-sided tension haemothorax, requiring insertion of two intercostal chest drains. A subsequent CT scan demonstrated a grade 4 right kidney laceration with active back bleeding from a renal artery branch, through a right diaphragmatic defect, into the pleural cavity. Embolisation of the feeding renal vessel controlled the bleeding and avoided the need for a nephrectomy. The patient required subsequent video-assisted thoracoscopic evacuation of the haemothorax and diaphragmatic repair, confirming that there was no associated lung or major vessel injury. A ureteric stent was ultimately inserted to manage a persistent urinary leak. This case highlights a rare cause for a common traumatic presentation and the need for a multidisciplinary approach in effective management of complex, multiorgan trauma.|Non-Cancer
ID:30124220|Title:[A case of growth hormone deficiency combined with neurofibromatosis Type 1 and its gene analysis].Abstract:Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by NF1 gene mutations. Cafe au lait spots, neurofibromatosis, Lisch nodules, axillary freckling, dermal neurofibromas and skeletal dysplasia are the most common manifestations for this disease. A 11-year-old boy visited Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University due to growth-retardation. He was eventually diagnosed as NF1 with growth hormone deficiency. A novel heterozygous splicing mutation c.6579+2 T>C (IVS 34+2 T>C) of NF1 gene was identified in the patient and his mother. Considering NF1 may present with short stature due to growth hormone deficiency, all children with short stature combined with cafe au lait spots should be screened for NF1, which may assist the clinical diagnosis and the genetic counseling.|Non-Cancer
ID:30150778|Title:Distinct systemic microbiome and microbial translocation are associated with plasma level of anti-CD4 autoantibody in HIV infection.Abstract:Microbial signals have been linked to autoantibody induction. Recently, we found that purified anti-CD4 autoantibodies from the plasma of chronic HIV-1-infected patients under viral-suppressed antiretroviral therapy (ART) play a pathologic role in poor CD4+ T cell recovery. The purpose of the study was to investigate the association of systemic microbiome and anti-CD4 autoantibody production in HIV. Plasma microbiome from 12 healthy controls and 22 HIV-infected subjects under viral-suppressed ART were analyzed by MiSeq sequencing. Plasma level of autoantibodies and microbial translocation (LPS, total bacterial 16S rDNA, soluble CD14, and LPS binding protein) were analyzed by ELISA, limulus amebocyte assay, and qPCR. We found that plasma level of anti-CD4 IgGs but not anti-CD8 IgGs was increased in HIV+ subjects compared to healthy controls. HIV+ subjects with plasma anti-CD4 IgG > 50 ng/mL (high) had reduced microbial diversity compared to HIV+ subjects with anti-CD4 IgG <= 50 ng/mL (low). Moreover, plasma anti-CD4 IgG level was associated with elevated microbial translocation and reduced microbial diversity in HIV+ subjects. The Alphaproteobacteria class was significantly enriched in HIV+ subjects with low anti-CD4 IgG compared to patients with high anti-CD4 IgG even after controlling for false discovery rate (FDR). The microbial components were different from the phylum to genus level in HIV+ subjects with high anti-CD4 IgGs compared to the other two groups, but these differences were not significant after controlling for FDR. These results suggest that systemic microbial translocation and microbiome may associate with anti-CD4 autoantibody production in ART-treated HIV disease.|Non-Cancer
ID:30154114|Title:SCID genotype and 6-month posttransplant CD4 count predict survival and immune recovery.Abstract:The Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC) performed a retrospective analysis of 662 patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) who received a hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as first-line treatment between 1982 and 2012 in 33 North American institutions. Overall survival was higher after HCT from matched-sibling donors (MSDs). Among recipients of non-MSD HCT, multivariate analysis showed that the SCID genotype strongly influenced survival and immune reconstitution. Overall survival was similar for patients with RAG, IL2RG, or JAK3 defects and was significantly better compared with patients with ADA or DCLRE1C mutations. Patients with RAG or DCLRE1C mutations had poorer immune reconstitution than other genotypes. Although survival did not correlate with the type of conditioning regimen, recipients of reduced-intensity or myeloablative conditioning had a lower incidence of treatment failure and better T- and B-cell reconstitution, but a higher risk for graft-versus-host disease, compared with those receiving no conditioning or immunosuppression only. Infection-free status and younger age at HCT were associated with improved survival. Typical SCID, leaky SCID, and Omenn syndrome had similar outcomes. Landmark analysis identified CD4+ and CD4+CD45RA+ cell counts at 6 and 12 months post-HCT as biomarkers predictive of overall survival and long-term T-cell reconstitution. Our data emphasize the need for patient-tailored treatment strategies depending upon the underlying SCID genotype. The prognostic significance of CD4+ cell counts as early as 6 months after HCT emphasizes the importance of close follow-up of immune reconstitution to identify patients who may need additional intervention to prevent poor long-term outcome.|Non-Cancer
ID:30177503|Title:Inheritance of OCT4 predetermines fate choice in human embryonic stem cells.Abstract:It is well known that clonal cells can make different fate decisions, but it is unclear whether these decisions are determined during, or before, a cell's own lifetime. Here, we engineered an endogenous fluorescent reporter for the pluripotency factor OCT4 to study the timing of differentiation decisions in human embryonic stem cells. By tracking single-cell OCT4 levels over multiple cell cycle generations, we found that the decision to differentiate is largely determined before the differentiation stimulus is presented and can be predicted by a cell's preexisting OCT4 signaling patterns. We further quantified how maternal OCT4 levels were transmitted to, and distributed between, daughter cells. As mother cells underwent division, newly established OCT4 levels in daughter cells rapidly became more predictive of final OCT4 expression status. These results imply that the choice between developmental cell fates can be largely predetermined at the time of cell birth through inheritance of a pluripotency factor.|Non-Cancer
ID:30179860|Title:Loss of placental growth factor ameliorates maternal hypertension and preeclampsia in mice.Abstract:Preeclampsia remains a clinical challenge due to its poorly understood pathogenesis. A prevailing notion is that increased placental production of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) causes the maternal syndrome by inhibiting proangiogenic placental growth factor (PlGF) and VEGF. However, the significance of PlGF suppression in preeclampsia is uncertain. To test whether preeclampsia results from the imbalance of angiogenic factors reflected by an abnormal sFlt-1/PlGF ratio, we studied PlGF KO (Pgf-/-) mice and noted that the mice did not develop signs or sequelae of preeclampsia despite a marked elevation in circulating sFLT-1. Notably, PlGF KO mice had morphologically distinct placentas, showing an accumulation of junctional zone glycogen. We next considered the role of placental PlGF in an established model of preeclampsia (pregnant catechol-O-methyltransferase-deficient [COMT-deficient] mice) by generating mice with deletions in both the Pgf and Comt genes. Deletion of placental PlGF in the context of COMT loss resulted in a reduction in maternal blood pressure and increased placental glycogen, indicating that loss of PlGF might be protective against the development of preeclampsia. These results identify a role for PlGF in placental development and support a complex model for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia beyond an angiogenic factor imbalance.|Non-Cancer
ID:30184455|Title:Baloxavir Marboxil for Uncomplicated Influenza in Adults and Adolescents.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Baloxavir marboxil is a selective inhibitor of influenza cap-dependent endonuclease. It has shown therapeutic activity in preclinical models of influenza A and B virus infections, including strains resistant to current antiviral agents. METHODS: We conducted two randomized, double-blind, controlled trials involving otherwise healthy outpatients with acute uncomplicated influenza. After a dose-ranging (10 to 40 mg) placebo-controlled trial, we undertook a placebo- and oseltamivir-controlled trial of single, weight-based doses of baloxavir (40 or 80 mg) in patients 12 to 64 years of age during the 2016-2017 season. The dose of oseltamivir was 75 mg twice daily for 5 days. The primary efficacy end point was the time to alleviation of influenza symptoms in the intention-to-treat infected population. RESULTS: In the phase 2 trial, the median time to alleviation of influenza symptoms was 23.4 to 28.2 hours shorter in the baloxavir groups than in the placebo group (P<0.05). In the phase 3 trial, the intention-to-treat infected population included 1064 patients; 84.8 to 88.1% of patients in each group had influenza A(H3N2) infection. The median time to alleviation of symptoms was 53.7 hours (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.5 to 58.5) with baloxavir, as compared with 80.2 hours (95% CI, 72.6 to 87.1) with placebo (P<0.001). The time to alleviation of symptoms was similar with baloxavir and oseltamivir. Baloxavir was associated with greater reductions in viral load 1 day after initiation of the regimen than placebo or oseltamivir. Adverse events were reported in 20.7% of baloxavir recipients, 24.6% of placebo recipients, and 24.8% of oseltamivir recipients. The emergence of polymerase acidic protein variants with I38T/M/F substitutions conferring reduced susceptibility to baloxavir occurred in 2.2% and 9.7% of baloxavir recipients in the phase 2 trial and phase 3 trial, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose baloxavir was without evident safety concerns, was superior to placebo in alleviating influenza symptoms, and was superior to both oseltamivir and placebo in reducing the viral load 1 day after initiation of the trial regimen in patients with uncomplicated influenza. Evidence for the development of decreased susceptibility to baloxavir after treatment was also observed.

ID:30188763|Title:Suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by EGF receptor is required for hair follicle development.Abstract:Mice that lack the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) fail to develop a hair coat, but the mechanism responsible for this deficit is not completely understood. Here, we show that EGFR plays a critical role to attenuate wingless-type MMTV integration site family member (Wnt)/beta-catenin signaling during postnatal hair follicle development. Genetic ablation of EGFR in mice resulted in increased mitotic activity in matrix cells, apoptosis in hair follicles, and impaired differentiation of epithelial lineages that form hair. EGFR is activated in wild-type hair follicle stem cells marked with SOX9 or NFATc1 and is essential to restrain proliferation and support stem cell numbers and their quiescence. We observed elevated levels of Wnt4, 6, 7b, 10a, 10b, and 16 transcripts and hyperactivation of the beta-catenin pathway in EGFR knockout follicles. Using primary keratinocytes, we linked ligand-induced EGFR activation to suppression of nascent mRNA synthesis of Wnt genes. Overexpression of the Wnt antagonist sFRP1 in mice lacking EGFR demonstrated that elevated Wnts are a major cause for the hair follicle defects. Colocalization of transforming growth factor alpha and Wnts regulated by EGFR in stem cells and progeny indicates that EGFR autocrine loops control Wnts. Our findings define a novel mechanism that integrates EGFR and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways to coordinate the delicate balance between proliferation and differentiation during development.|Non-Cancer
ID:30201950|Title:Hepatic Ago2-mediated RNA silencing controls energy metabolism linked to AMPK activation and obesity-associated pathophysiology.Abstract:RNA silencing inhibits mRNA translation. While mRNA translation accounts for the majority of cellular energy expenditure, it is unclear if RNA silencing regulates energy homeostasis. Here, we report that hepatic Argonaute 2 (Ago2)-mediated RNA silencing regulates both intrinsic energy production and consumption and disturbs energy metabolism in the pathogenesis of obesity. Ago2 regulates expression of specific miRNAs including miR-802, miR-103/107, and miR-148a/152, causing metabolic disruption, while simultaneously suppressing the expression of genes regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, including Hnf1beta, Cav1, and Ampka1. Liver-specific Ago2-deletion enhances mitochondrial oxidation and ATP consumption associated with mRNA translation, which results in AMPK activation, and improves obesity-associated pathophysiology. Notably, hepatic Ago2-deficiency improves glucose metabolism in conditions of insulin receptor antagonist treatment, high-fat diet challenge, and hepatic AMPKalpha1-deletion. The regulation of energy metabolism by Ago2 provides a novel paradigm in which RNA silencing plays an integral role in determining basal metabolic activity in obesity-associated sequelae.|Non-Cancer
ID:30207489|Title:The Italian Mastocytosis Registry: 6-year experience from a hospital-based registry.Abstract:AIM: We collected 'real-life' data on the management of patients with mastocytosis in the Italian Mastocytosis Registry. METHODS: Six hundred patients diagnosed with mastocytosis between 1974 and 2014 were included from 19 centers. RESULTS: Among adults (n = 401); 156 (38.9%) patients were diagnosed with systemic mastocytosis. In 212 adults, no bone marrow studies were performed resulting in a provisional diagnosis of mastocytosis of the skin. This diagnosis was most frequently established in nonhematologic centers. In total, 182/184 pediatric patients had cutaneous mastocytosis. We confirmed that in the most patients with systemic mastocytosis, serum tryptase levels were >20 ng/ml and KIT D816V was detectable. CONCLUSION: The Italian Mastocytosis Registry revealed some center-specific approaches for diagnosis and therapy. Epidemiological evidence on this condition is provided.|Non-Cancer
ID:30216543|Title:Functional monoamine oxidase B gene intron 13 polymorphism predicts putaminal dopamine turnover in de novo Parkinson's disease.Abstract:OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of common functional polymorphisms in genes involved in dopamine metabolism on striatal dopamine turnover in de novo Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: This was an observer-blinded cohort study investigating effects of common functional polymorphisms in dopa decarboxylase (DDC, rs921451), monoamine oxidase B (MAOB; rs1799836), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT, rs4680), and dopamine transporter/solute carrier family 6 member 3 (DAT/SLC6A3, variable number tandem repeats) genes on 18 F-fluorodopa uptake and an effective distribution volume ratio (inverse of dopamine turnover) measured by 18 F-fluorodopa PET in 28 untreated PD patients. RESULTS: Patients carrying the MAOBCC/(C)/CT genotype (low/intermediate enzyme activity) had a lower dopamine turnover in the putamen (higher mean effective distribution volume ratio) when compared with patients with MAOBTT/(T) genotype (high enzyme activity). Striatal PET measures were not different between variants in the remaining genes. CONCLUSIONS: The MAOB (rs1799836) polymorphism predicts putaminal dopamine turnover in early PD with the MAOBTT allele linked to high enzyme activity leading to higher intrinsic dopamine turnover, which has been demonstrated to constitute a risk factor for motor complications.   2018 The Authors.

ID:30224494|Title:Influenza hemagglutinin membrane anchor.Abstract:Viruses with membranes fuse them with cellular membranes, to transfer their genomes into cells at the beginning of infection. For Influenza virus, the membrane glycoprotein involved in fusion is the hemagglutinin (HA), the 3D structure of which is known from X-ray crystallographic studies. The soluble ectodomain fragments used in these studies lacked the "membrane anchor" portion of the molecule. Since this region has a role in membrane fusion, we have determined its structure by analyzing the intact, full-length molecule in a detergent micelle, using cryo-EM. We have also compared the structures of full-length HA-detergent micelles with full-length HA-Fab complex detergent micelles, to describe an infectivity-neutralizing monoclonal Fab that binds near the ectodomain membrane anchor junction. We determine a high-resolution HA structure which compares favorably in detail with the structure of the ectodomain seen by X-ray crystallography; we detect, clearly, all five carbohydrate side chains of HA; and we find that the ectodomain is joined to the membrane anchor by flexible, eight-residue-long, linkers. The linkers extend into the detergent micelle to join a central triple-helical structure that is a major component of the membrane anchor.|Non-Cancer

A boy with cafe-au-lait spots manifested restrictive cardiomyopathy. Whole exome sequencing confirmed the genetic diagnosis of neurofibromatosis and further identified a novel titin (TTN) missense variant. The significance of the variant is supported by its de novo origin, in silico predictions, and evolutionary conservation. Modern genetics raises an intriguing explanation for the unexpected phenotype and adds to the evolving role of TTN variants in cardiomyopathy.|Non-Cancer

She had a swelling above the upper lip and multiple brown spots on her face, neck, arms and back. She was globally delayed, deaf, dumb and photophobic. MRI brain showed mild cerebral atrophy and bilateral demyelination. De Sanctis Cacchione variant (dSCS) and Rothmund Thomson syndrome (RTS), which were among the differential diagnosis were ruled out upon careful evaluation. Supportive treatment was given and regular checkups were recommended to monitor the progression of the disease but our patient did not show up for the follow up. This report shows that the diagnosis of XP-CS can be based on clinical features and MRI findings when the genetic testing is not available.|Non-Cancer
ID:30343341|Title:Ataxia telangiectasia alters the ApoB and reelin pathway.Abstract:Autosomal recessive ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, and cerebellar neurodegeneration. A-T is caused by inactivating mutations in the ataxia telangiectasiamutated (ATM) gene, a serine-threonine protein kinase involved in DNA damage response and excitatory neurotransmission. The selective vulnerability of cerebellar Purkinje neurons (PN) to A-T is not well understood. Employing global proteomic profiling of cerebrospinal fluid from patients at ages around 15 years, we detected reduced calbindin, reelin, cerebellin-1, cerebellin-3, protocadherin fat 2, sempahorin 7A, and increased apolipoprotein B and J peptides. Bioinformatic enrichment was observed for pathways of lipoproteins, endocytosis, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, peptidase activity, adhesion, calcium binding, and complement immunity. This seemed important since secretion of reelin from glutamatergic afferent axons is crucial for PN lipoprotein receptor endocytosis and lipid signaling. Reelin expression is downregulated by irradiation and reelin/ApoB mutations are known causes of ataxia. Validation efforts in 2-month-old Atm-/- mice before onset of motor deficits confirmed cerebellar transcript reductions for reelin receptors Apoer2/Vldlr with increases for their ligands Apoe/Apoh and cholesterol 24-hydroxylase Cyp46a1. Concomitant dysregulations were found for Vglut2/Sema7a as climbing fiber markers, glutamate receptors like Grin2b, and calcium homeostasis factors (Atp2b2, Calb1, Itpr1), while factors involved in DNA damage, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cell adhesion were normal at this stage. Quantitative immunoblots confirmed ApoB and ApoJ increases and VLDLR reduction in cerebellar tissue at the age of 2 months. These findings show that ApoB excess and reelin signaling deficits reflect the neurodegeneration in A-T in a sensitive and specific way. As extracellular factors, apolipoproteins and their cargo such as vitamin E may be useful for neuroprotective interventions.|Non-Cancer
ID:30389854|Title:WNT/beta-catenin signaling plays a crucial role in myoblast fusion through regulation of nephrin expression during development.Abstract:Skeletal muscle development is controlled by a series of multiple orchestrated regulatory pathways. WNT/beta-catenin is one of the most important pathways for myogenesis; however, it remains unclear how this signaling pathway regulates myogenesis in a temporal- and spatial-specific manner. Here, we show that WNT/beta-catenin signaling is crucial for myoblast fusion through regulation of the nephrin (Nphs1) gene in the Myog-Cre-expressing myoblast population. Mice deficient for the beta-catenin gene in Myog-Cre-expressing myoblasts (Ctnnb1F/F;Myog-Cre mice) displayed myoblast fusion defects, but not migration or cell proliferation defects. The promoter region of Nphs1 contains the conserved beta-catenin-binding element, and Nphs1 expression was induced by the activation of WNT/beta-catenin signaling. The induction of Nphs1 in cultured myoblasts from Ctnnb1F/F;Myog-Cre mice restored the myoblast fusion defect, indicating that nephrin is functionally relevant in WNT/beta-catenin-dependent myoblast fusion. Taken together, our results indicate that WNT/beta-catenin signaling is crucial for myoblast fusion through the regulation of the Nphs1 gene.|Non-Cancer
ID:30405212|Title:Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate discontinuation for renal outcomes: any room for treatment personalization?Abstract:Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a very effective antiviral drug that has been associated with tubular dysfunction. The aim of this study was to analyze the demographic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic variables associated with TDF discontinuation for renal outcomes in stable HIV-positive patients using multivariable analyses. Three hundred and four patients were included (73% male, with median age and eCrCl of 45.3 years and 90.9 mL/min, respectively). After a median follow-up of 28.3 months, 27 patients discontinued TDF for renal adverse events [persistent urinary abnormalities (n = 21) or eCrCl < 60 mL/min (n = 6)] providing an incidence of 3.77 events per 100 patient-year. The probability of TDF discontinuation was higher with several features (male gender, older age, not Caucasians ancestry, absence of intravenous drug abuse, protease inhibitors, previous indinavir, HCV-positivity, lower CD4 cell count, detectable HIV-RNA, lower eCrCl, spot-urine proteinuria) and higher tenofovir concentrations but not genetic variants. Tenofovir plasma concentrations were prognostic of TDF discontinuation for renal adverse events suggesting that dose-adjustment may be warranted for long-term safety.|Non-Cancer
ID:30414531|Title:Identification of a somatic mutation in the RHEB gene through high depth and ultra-high depth next generation sequencing in a patient with Hemimegalencephaly and drug resistant Epilepsy.Abstract:Malformations of cortical development are a frequent cause of drug-resistant Epilepsy and developmental delay. Hemimegalencephaly is a Malformation of cortical development characterized by enlargement of all or a part of one cerebral hemisphere. Germline and somatic mutation in genes belonging to the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been identified in patients suffering from epilepsy secondary to Hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia. We present here a patient suffering from severe neonatal Epilepsy since 3 h of life secondary to Hemimegalencephaly, requiring an anatomic hemispherectomy surgical procedure for seizure control, where by means of next-generation sequencing at an ultra-high depth coverage, we were able to identify a novel somatic mutation in the RHEB gene (NM_005614: c.119A > T: p. Glu40Val). The histopathological diagnosis was Cortical Dysplasia type IIB determined by the presence of dysmorphic neurons of variable size with nuclear alteration and balloon cells in the context of Hemimegalencephaly, which are similar to that have been demonstrated in hyperactivating RHEB models. This is the first report of a somatic mutation in RHEB gene in a patient suffering from Epilepsy secondary to Hemimegalencephaly. It highlights different current topics in the fields of genetics of Malformations of cortical development: a-somatic mosaicism is not uncommon in these neurodevelopmental disorders; b-the molecular diagnostic approach should involve the use of state-of-the-art methods and the sampling of different tissues; c-new findings might facilitate therapeutics discoveries while providing an improved understanding of normal brain development.|Non-Cancer
ID:30475086|Title:Cystic Hygroma: A Preliminary Genetic Study and a Short Review from the Literature.Abstract:BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to examine the hypothesis that cystic hygroma (CH) with normal karyotype can manifest as a Mendelian inherited trait, and that a genetic similitude with hereditary lymphedema exists. To reach this goal, we investigated the prevalence of genetic variants in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis genes in a cohort of euploid fetuses with CH that almost resolved before delivery. A short review of cases from literature is also reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five fetuses were screened using a next-generation sequencing approach by targeting 33 genes known to be associated with vascular and lymphatic malformations. The genetic evaluation revealed two novel variants in KDR and KRIT1 genes. CONCLUSION: A review of the literature to date revealed that an association exists between CH and hereditary lymphedema and, similar to lymphedema, CH can be inherited in autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant manner, with the latter most likely associated with a better prognosis. About KDR and KRIT1 genes, no other similar associations are reported in the literature and caution is needed in their interpretation. In conclusion, we thought that a genetic test for the outcome of familial CH could be of enormous prognostic value.|Non-Cancer
ID:30488427|Title:Detection of KIT D816V in peripheral blood of children with manifestations of cutaneous mastocytosis suggests systemic disease.Abstract:The use of allele-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction to identify KIT D816V in the peripheral blood of adults with mastocytosis has been reported to have value in the diagnosis, assessment of disease burden and management of this disease. To examine the value of this assay in children with cutaneous manifestations of mastocytosis, we assessed data on 65 patients with all variants of paediatric-onset mastocytosis, including those known to have systemic disease, to correlate KIT mutation status with clinical findings, serum tryptase levels and bone marrow histopathology. We found that KIT D816V was not identified in the peripheral blood of children known to have only cutaneous disease (specificity 100%) but was found in those known to have both cutaneous and systemic/probable systemic disease (sensitivity of 85 2%). These findings were the basis of the development of an algorithm to assist in the decision for when to perform a bone marrow biopsy in children presenting with cutaneous manifestations of mastocytosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:30513309|Title:Circular RNA involvement in aging: An emerging player with great potential.Abstract:Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of newly discovered noncoding RNA (ncRNA), presenting as a special covalent loop without a 5' cap or 3' tail. Multiple biological properties of circRNA have been revealed during the past decades, such as widespread expression, high conservation, cell-specificity, tissue-specificity and developmental stage-specific expression patterns, as well as resistance to RNase R digestion. CircRNA also exhibits diverse biological functions, including regulation of host genes, alternative splicing, miRNA sponges, protein traps and even protein synthesis. Recently, a global accumulation of circRNAs during aging has been identified across different species, indicating a potential role as a causal factor in aging and age-related disease. The high stability could be one of the mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon. CircRNA could play a role in aging, such as neural aging, muscle aging, reproductive aging, skin aging, immunosenescence, visual aging and age-related diseases like Alzheimer's disease, via interaction with miRNAs, RNA binding proteins, modulation of parental gene transcription, mainly at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The present study will focus on the advancement of circRNA regarding aging and age-related diseases. We will also discuss the biogenesis, properties, biological functions, and the perspectives of circRNA.|Non-Cancer
ID:30514913|Title:Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency with a focus on newborn screening.Abstract:Carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) II deficiency is one of the most common forms of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorder. Its clinical phenotypes are classified into the muscle, severe infantile, and lethal neonatal forms. Among Caucasians, the muscle form predominates, and the c.338C > T (p.S113L) variant is detected in most cases, whereas among the Japanese, c.1148T > A (p.F383Y) is the variant allele occurring with the highest frequency and can apparently cause symptoms of the severe infantile form. Newborn screening (NBS) for this potentially fatal disease has not been established. We encountered an infantile case of CPT II deficiency not detected in NBS using C16 and C18:1 concentrations as indices, and therefore we adopted the (C16 + C18:1)/C2 ratio as an alternative primary index. As a result, the disease was diagnosed in nine of 31 NBS-positive subjects. The values for (C16 + C18:1)/C2 in the affected newborns partly overlapped with those in unaffected ones. Among several other indices proposed previously, C14/C3 has emerged as a more promising index. Based on these findings, nationwide NBS for CPT II deficiency using both (C16 + C18:1)/C2 and C14/C3 as indices was officially approved and started in April 2018. We diagnosed the disease in four young children presenting with symptoms of the muscle form, whose values for the new indices were not elevated. Although it is still difficult to detect all cases of the muscle form of CPT II deficiency in NBS, our system is expected to save many affected children in Japan with the severe infantile form predominating.|Non-Cancer
ID:30517645|Title:JUNO, the receptor of sperm IZUMO1, is expressed by the human oocyte and is essential for human fertilisation.Abstract:STUDY QUESTION: Is JUNO protein present at the surface membrane of human oocytes and involved in the fertilisation process? SUMMARY ANSWER: JUNO protein is expressed on the plasma membrane of human oocytes and its inhibition by a monoclonal antibody completely blocks gamete fusion. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Fusion of gamete membranes is the culminating event of the fertilisation process, but its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Until now, three molecules have been shown to be essential: CD9 tetraspanin in the oocyte, Izumo1 protein on the sperm and Juno, its corresponding receptor on the oocyte. Oocyte CD9 and sperm IZUMO1 have been identified in human gametes and their interaction is also well-conserved among several mammalian species. The presence of JUNO on human oocytes, however, has not yet been reported, nor has its role in fertilisation been investigated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We selected an anti-human JUNO antibody in order to investigate the presence of JUNO on the oocyte membrane surface and studied its potential involvement in gamete membrane interaction during fertilisation. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Monoclonal antibodies against human JUNO (anti-hJUNO mAb) were produced by immunisation of mice with HEK cells transfected with the putative human JUNO sequence (HEK-hJUNO). These antibodies were used for immunostaining experiments and in vitro fertilisation assays with human gametes (GERMETHEQUE Biobank). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Three hybridoma supernatants, verified by immunostaining, revealed specifically HEK-hJUNO cells. The three purified monoclonal antibodies, FJ2E4 (IgG1), FJ8E8 (IgG1) and FJ4F5 (IgG2a), recognised the soluble recombinant human JUNO protein and, in a western blot of HEK-hJUNO extracts, a protein with an expected MW of 25 kDa. In addition, soluble recombinant human IZUMO protein inhibited the binding of anti-hJUNO mAbs to cells expressing hJUNO. Using these anti-hJUNO mAbs in immunostaining, we identified the presence of JUNO protein at the plasma membrane of human oocytes. Furthermore, we revealed a progressive expression of JUNO according to oocyte maturity. Finally, we showed that human zona-free oocytes, inseminated in the presence of anti-hJUNO mAb, were not fertilised by human sperm. These results suggest that, as seen in the mouse, JUNO is indeed involved in human gamete membrane fusion during fertilisation. LARGE-SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: In accordance with French bioethics laws, functional tests were performed using zona-free oocytes, which of course does not fully encompass all normal in vivo physiological conditions. However, these in vitro tests do provide direct information regarding sperm-oocyte membrane interactions. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Mechanisms of gamete fusion appear to be homologous between mice and humans. However, some differences do exist and analysing the human mechanisms is essential. In fact, this is the first report describing the presence of JUNO on human oocytes and its involvement in human fertilisation. This discovery allows further examination of the understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive gamete fusion: a crucial challenge at a time when infertility affects 16% of reproductively active couples. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: This work was supported by the Agence Nationale pour la Recherche, Grant no. ANR-13-BVS5-0004, and by Association Institut du Cancer et d'Immunogenetique (ICIG).

ID:30545997|Title:Systemic Mastocytosis, Version 2.2019, NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology.Abstract:Mastocytosis is a group of heterogeneous disorders resulting from the clonal proliferation of abnormal mast cells and their accumulation in the skin and/or in various extracutaneous organs. Systemic mastocytosis is the most common form of mastocytosis diagnosed in adults, characterized by mast cell infiltration of one or more extracutaneous organs (with or without skin involvement). The identification of KIT D816V mutation and the emergence of novel targeted therapies have significantly improved the diagnosis and treatment of systemic mastocytosis. However, certain aspects of clinical care, particularly the diagnosis, assessment, and management of mediator-related symptoms continue to present challenges. This manuscript discusses the recommendations outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with systemic mastocytosis.|Non-Cancer
ID:30558068|Title:Familial intracranial arachnoid cysts with a missense mutation (c.2576C > T) in RERE: A case report.Abstract:RATIONALE: Arachnoid cysts are relatively common intracranial space-occupying lesions; nevertheless, familial intracranial arachnoid cysts are extremely rare, with only a few cases having been reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: The proband was a 7-year-old girl who had experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures 5 times in the 8 days prior to admission. Nine months later, her 6-year-old younger female cousin presented to us with a 3-day history of headache. DIAGNOSES: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the diagnosis of arachnoid cyst for both of the girls. INTERVENTIONS: A cyst-peritoneal shunting and cyst fenestration were performed for the 7-year-old girl and her cousin separately. Sanger sequencing revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (c.2576C > T) in the Arginine-Glutamic Acid Dipeptide Repeats gene (RERE). OUTCOMES: The outcome was favorable and the follow-up was uneventful. LESSONS: We hypothesize that the mutation in RERE may be associated with the pathogenesis of familial intracranial arachnoid cysts.|Non-Cancer
ID:30580065|Title:Arteriovenous Fistula Inside Cervical Spinal Canal Associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutation on chromosome 17, which affects the skin, vascular system, nervous system, and skeleton system. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is one of the recognized complications of NF-1. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 33-year-old woman with NF-1 with cervical spine AVF inside the cervical spinal canal who presented with progressive spinal cord compression which was abnormal. After sufficient preparation, the patient underwent vascular embolization, and then symptoms of spinal cord compression significantly improved. CONCLUSIONS: This report reminds readers of the possibility of AVF if there is a space-occupying lesion inside the cervical spinal canal and to do computed tomography angiography examination when necessary.|Non-Cancer

ID:30609671|Title:Development of [131I]I-EOE-TPZ and [131I]I-EOE-TPZMO: Novel Tirapazamine (TPZ)-Based Radioiodinated Pharmaceuticals for Application in Theranostic Management of Hypoxia.Abstract:Introduction: Benzotriazine-1,4-dioxides (BTDOs) such as tirapazamine (TPZ) and its derivatives act as radiosensitizers of hypoxic tissues. The benzotriazine-1-monoxide (BTMO) metabolite (SR 4317, TPZMO) of TPZ also has radiosensitizing properties, and via unknown mechanisms, is a potent enhancer of the radiosensitizing effects of TPZ. Unlike their 2-nitroimidazole radiosensitizer counterparts, radiolabeled benzotriazine oxides have not been used as radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic imaging or molecular radiotherapy (MRT) of hypoxia. The radioiodination chemistry for preparing model radioiodinated BTDOs and BTMOs is now reported. Hypothesis: Radioiodinated 3-(2-iodoethoxyethyl)-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4-dioxide (I-EOE-TPZ), a novel bioisosteric analogue of TPZ, and 3-(2-iodoethoxyethyl)-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1-oxide (I-EOE-TPZMO), its monoxide analogue, are candidates for in vivo and in vitro investigations of biochemical mechanisms in pathologies that develop hypoxic microenvironments. In theory, both radiotracers can be prepared from the same precursors. Methods: Radioiodination procedures were based on classical nucleophilic [131I]iodide substitution on Tos-EOE-TPZ (P1) and by [131I]iodide exchange on I-EOE-TPZ (P2). Reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, solvent and the influence of pivalic acid on products' formation and the corresponding radiochemical yields (RCY) were investigated. Results: The [131I]iodide labeling reactions invariably led to the synthesis of both products, but with careful manipulation of conditions the preferred product could be recovered as the major product. Radioiodide exchange on P2 in ACN at 80 +- 5  C for 30 min afforded the highest RCY, 89%, of [131I]I-EOE-TPZ, which upon solid phase purification on an alumina cartridge gave 60% yield of the product with over 97% of radiochemical purity. Similarly, radioiodide exchange on P2 in ACN at 50 +- 5  C for 30 min with pivalic acid afforded the highest yield, 92%, of [131I]I-EOE-TPZMO exclusively with no trace of [131I]I-EOE-TPZ. In both cases, extended reaction times and/or elevated temperatures resulted in the formation of at least two additional radioactive reaction products. Conclusions: Radioiodination of P1 and P2 with [131I]iodide leads to the facile formation of [131I]I-EOE-TPZMO. At 80  C and short reaction times, the facile reduction of the N-4-oxide moiety was minimized to afford acceptable radiochemical yields of [131I]I-EOE-TPZ from either precursor. Regeneration of [131I]I-EOE-TPZ from [131I]I-EOE-TPZMO is impractical after reaction work-up.|Non-Cancer
ID:30639322|Title:ZMIZ1 Variants Cause a Syndromic Neurodevelopmental Disorder.Abstract:ZMIZ1 is a coactivator of several transcription factors, including p53, the androgen receptor, and NOTCH1. Here, we report 19 subjects with intellectual disability and developmental delay carrying variants in ZMIZ1. The associated features include growth failure, feeding difficulties, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and various other congenital malformations. Of these 19, 14 unrelated subjects carried de novo heterozygous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) or single-base insertions/deletions, 3 siblings harbored a heterozygous single-base insertion, and 2 subjects had a balanced translocation disrupting ZMIZ1 or involving a regulatory region of ZMIZ1. In total, we identified 13 point mutations that affect key protein regions, including a SUMO acceptor site, a central disordered alanine-rich motif, a proline-rich domain, and a transactivation domain. All identified variants were absent from all available exome and genome databases. In vitro, ZMIZ1 showed impaired coactivation of the androgen receptor. In vivo, overexpression of ZMIZ1 mutant alleles in developing mouse brains using in utero electroporation resulted in abnormal pyramidal neuron morphology, polarization, and positioning, underscoring the importance of ZMIZ1 in neural development and supporting mutations in ZMIZ1 as the cause of a rare neurodevelopmental syndrome.|Non-Cancer
ID:30651914|Title:Aneurysmal bone cyst of the frontal bone - A radiologic-pathologic correlation.Abstract:We present a case of 27-year-old female who presented for a progressive frontal swelling with ipsilateral headache. Subsequent CT scan revealed an extradural and expansile multiloculated mass with thin and strongly enhanced septations and MRI evaluation showed internal hyperintensity on T2 with no restriction of diffusion and confirmed the multiple cystic spaces with enhancing septations and rare hemorrhagic fluid-fluid levels. Surgery was performed and diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst was made on frozen section. Identification of USP6 fusion gene by in situ hybridization technique permitted to confirm the diagnosis of primary ABC. Although aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) of the skull is a very rare entity and accounts for 2-6% of all ABCs, we should think about it in front of osteolytic and cystic skull changes even with very few fluid-fluid levels. Following description of our case and differential diagnoses, we conduct a literature review of skull ABCs imaging characteristics and discuss the interest of USP6 rearrangement identification.|Non-Cancer
ID:30704988|Title:Editing aberrant splice sites efficiently restores beta-globin expression in beta-thalassemia.Abstract:The thalassemias are compelling targets for therapeutic genome editing in part because monoallelic correction of a subset of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) would be sufficient for enduring disease amelioration. A primary challenge is the development of efficient repair strategies that are effective in HSCs. Here, we demonstrate that allelic disruption of aberrant splice sites, one of the major classes of thalassemia mutations, is a robust approach to restore gene function. We target the IVS1-110G>A mutation using Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and the IVS2-654C>T mutation by Cas12a/Cpf1 RNP in primary CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from beta-thalassemia patients. Each of these nuclease complexes achieves high efficiency and penetrance of therapeutic edits. Erythroid progeny of edited patient HSPCs show reversal of aberrant splicing and restoration of beta-globin expression. This strategy could enable correction of a substantial fraction of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia genotypes with currently available gene-editing technology.|Non-Cancer
ID:30778901|Title:Disruption of Spermatogenesis and Infertility in Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia Type 2 (AOA2).Abstract:Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) is a rare autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia characterized by onset between 10 and 20 years of age and a range of neurological features that include progressive cerebellar atrophy, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, oculomotor apraxia in a majority of patients, and elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). AOA2 is caused by mutation of the SETX gene which encodes senataxin, a DNA/RNA helicase involved in transcription regulation, RNA processing, and DNA maintenance. Disruption of senataxin in rodents led to defective spermatogenesis and sterility in males uncovering a key role for senataxin in male germ cell survival. Here, we report the first clinical and cellular evidence of impaired spermatogenesis in AOA2 patients. We assessed sperm production in three AOA2 patients and testicular pathology in one patient and compared the findings to those of Setx-knockout mice. Sperm production was impaired in all patients assessed (3/3, 100%). Analyses of testicular biopsies from an AOA2 patient recapitulate features of the histology seen in Setx-knockout mice, strongly suggesting an underlying mechanism centering on DNA-damage-mediated germ cell apoptosis. These findings support a role for senataxin in human reproductive function and highlight a novel clinical feature of AOA2 that extends the extra-neurological roles of senataxin. This raises an important reproductive counseling issue for clinicians, and fertility specialists should be aware of SETX mutations as a possible diagnosis in young male patients presenting with oligospermia or azoospermia since infertility may presage the later onset of neurological manifestations in some individuals.|Non-Cancer
ID:30818012|Title:Mucus penetrating properties of soft, distensible lipid nanocapsules.Abstract:Designing nanomaterials to release their drug pay-load upon exposure to an exogenous trigger can help to direct drug delivery, but how the triggered release, which often modifies the nanomaterial properties, influences the biological fate of these systems is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate how the triggered drug release from PEG coated, soft, 50 nm distensible lipid nanocapsules (LNC) influenced their diffusion across a mucus barrier. The translocation speed of the non-triggered LNC across a 35 microm thick purified gastric mucin (PGM) barrier was 3 times faster (30.08 +- 2.49 x 10-10 cm2 s-1) compared to equivalent-sized negatively charged polystyrene particles (9.87 +- 0.61 x 10-10 cm2 s-1, p < 0.05). In cystic fibrosis mucus (CFM), harvested from patient primary cells, the non-triggered LNC translocation speed was similar to the PGM, but the polystyrene particle diffusion was so slow it could not be measured. The trigger induced LNC distension process had no effect on the particle diffusion rate in both PGM and CFM (p > 0.05) in a static mucus barrier, but when shear was applied to the barrier the distended LNCs diffused more slowly (3.97 +- 1.38 x 10-8 cm2 s-1, p < 0.05) compared to the non-distended materials (4.94 +- 0.04 x 10-8 cm2 s-1). This data suggested the rapid mucus penetration of the distended LNCs, despite their increased size, was a consequence of their capacity to take a less tortuous path through the barrier, i.e., they experienced less steric hinderance, compared to the non-distended LNC.|Non-Cancer
ID:30820047|Title:Genetic meta-analysis of diagnosed Alzheimer's disease identifies new risk loci and implicates Abeta, tau, immunity and lipid processing.Abstract:Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Abeta processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 x 10-7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education.|Non-Cancer
ID:30904793|Title:Giant Cerebral Aneurysm in a Patient with Cowden Syndrome Treated with Surgical Clipping.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Cowden syndrome is characterized by multiple hamartomas and accompanied by a germline mutation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog gene. Cowden syndrome has been described to be associated with vascular anomalies such as arteriovenous malformation and developmental venous anomalies with high frequency. However, the association of cerebral aneurysms with this syndrome has not been reported yet. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 39-year-old Japanese man presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured giant fusiform middle cerebral artery aneurysm. We diagnosed him with Cowden syndrome by clinical presentations as outlined in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's criteria. As the ruptured fusiform aneurysm involved a middle cerebral artery bifurcation, we prepared for extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery. We successfully performed a surgical clipping using multiple tandem clipping techniques and suction decompression techniques. Bypass surgery was not performed as reconstruction of the M2 trunks was successfully completed. CONCLUSIONS: We present this rare case that potentially indicates an association between cerebral aneurysms and Cowden syndrome. Because vascular anomalies are not included in the diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome, intracranial vascular anomalies may be underestimated. We therefore recommended a careful search of vascular diseases, including cerebral aneurysms, in cases of Cowden syndrome.|Non-Cancer
ID:30950529|Title:15 N MRI of SLIC-SABRE Hyperpolarized 15 N-Labelled Pyridine and Nicotinamide.Abstract:Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful non-invasive diagnostic method extensively used in biomedical studies. A significant limitation of MRI is its relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, which can be increased by hyperpolarizing nuclear spins. One promising method is Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE), which employs parahydrogen as a source of hyperpolarization. Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility to improve MRI sensitivity with this hyperpolarization technique. Hyperpolarized 15 N nuclei in biomolecules can potentially retain their spin alignment for tens of minutes, providing an extended time window for the utilization of the hyperpolarized compounds. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that radio-frequency-based SABRE hyperpolarization techniques can be used to obtain 15 N MRI of biomolecule 1-15 N-nicotinamide. Two image acquisition strategies were utilized and compared: Single Point Imaging (SPI) and Fast Low Angle SHot (FLASH). These methods demonstrated opportunities of high-field SABRE for biomedical applications.|Non-Cancer
ID:30988224|Title:[Tuberous Sclerosis Complex].Abstract:Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorders that is characterized by the systemic hamartomas, along with epilepsy, cognitive impairment and hypopigmented macules. It is caused by genetic mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 gene which encodes hamartin and tuberin, respectively. As the hamartin-tuberin-complex downregulates the mechanistic/mammalian target of the rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1), dysfunction in either hamartin or tuberin induces the constitutive activation of mTORC1. In fact, almost all the symptoms in TSC are derived from the activation of mTORC1. Therefore, mTORC1 inhibitors improves all the symptoms, including skin lesions and neural symptoms. Among the many symptoms, skin lesions appear earlier than renal or pulmonary lesions and are more specific than neuronal symptoms. Therefore, skin lesions are useful for the diagnosis of TSC. This chapter focuses on the features of skin lesions and mechanistic their potential role in differential diagnosis and therapy including the therapeutic use of mTORC1 inhibitors.|Non-Cancer
ID:31005870|Title:Hereditary segmental neurofibromatosis: a report of three cases in a family.Abstract:Hereditary segmental neurofibromatosis (SNF) is an extremely rare form of SNF with nine families reported till date. SNF is considered to be a result of mosaicism and hereditary transmission is possibly explained by increased susceptibility of mutations at neurofibromatosis gene loci. We report here three members of an Indian family with SNF. Our index case, a 20-year-old woman had multiple soft to firm papules and nodules over right shoulder associated with severe intermittent pain. Her father had three similar nodules over left upper arm and elder sister had two such nodules over right upper arm. The father and elder sister were incidentally diagnosed and they had never sought medical advice considering their lesions to be a familial trait. In the absence of symptoms, many familial cases of SNF are missed thus making any systematic analysis to ascertain its genetic basis difficult.|Non-Cancer
ID:31009132|Title:Frequency of isolated cutaneous involvement in adult mastocytosis: a cohort study.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is characterized by the accumulation/proliferation of abnormal mast cells. The frequency of isolated cutaneous involvement in adults with mastocytosis has not been fully determined. The main objective of our study was to assess the frequency of isolated cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) in adults with mastocytosis skin lesions. The second objective was to compare the clinical, histological, biological and imaging features in patients with isolated CM and patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM). METHODS: We included all patients with histology-proven mastocytosis skin lesions between January 2009 and December 2017. The mastocytosis diagnosis was made according to the international diagnostic criteria. All data were collected from a dedicated specific case report. RESULTS: Among 160 patients with mastocytosis skin lesions, 25 patients had isolated CM (15.6%), 105 had SM and 30 (18.7%) patients had undetermined mastocytosis. Skin KIT mutation (OR: 51.9, 95% CI: 3.9-678, P = 0.001) and high bone marrow tryptase (OR: 97.4, 95% CI: 10.3-915, P = 0.001) were strong predictors of SM. The prevalence of osteoporosis was higher in the SM population than in the isolated CM population. Moreover, a decrease in bone mineral density over a short period of follow-up (1-2 years) was associated with SM. There were no differences between the two groups regarding the frequency of mast cell activation symptoms, the presentation of skin lesions, the number of mast cells in the dermis and the level of serum tryptase. We propose considering the KIT mutation status and bone marrow tryptase levels to aid the diagnosis of isolated CM in adult mastocytosis patients. CONCLUSION: Only a small minority of adults with mastocytosis skin lesions has isolated cutaneous involvement. In 18.7% of mastocytosis cases, even complete workup does not allow for a precise classification of patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:31026806|Title:Transcription Factor STAT3 Serves as a Negative Regulator Controlling IgE Class Switching in Mice.Abstract:A mutation in STAT3 has been linked to the incidence of autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome, a disease characterized by elevated serum IgE Ab. However, how this genetic mutation leads to the phenotype has not been fully understood. We investigated the specific role of STAT3 in the germinal center (GC) B cells and plasma cells for IgE class switching. Through the use of STAT3 conditional knockout (cKO) mice in a Th2-type immunization model, we demonstrated that CD2-Cre-driven STAT3 cKO mice showed elevated IgE and decreased IgG1 in the serum and a reduction in GC formation. Within the GC, IgG1 + GC B cells were decreased, whereas IgE+ GC B cells were more prevalent. Additionally, these mice exhibited reduced IgG1 and elevated IgE populations of Ab-producing plasma cells. Subsequent experiments using a CD19-Cre cKO mouse established this effect to be B cell-intrinsic. Transcription factors critical for GC and plasma cell differentiation, including Bcl-6 and Aicda, were shown to function as downstream signals of STAT3 regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis revealed that many genes, including Bcl3 and Crtc2, were among the direct STAT3 regulated targets. Mice with STAT3 deficiency in B cells also demonstrated an increase in lung inflammation when used in an asthma-like disease model. This model suggests a negative role for STAT3 in regulating class switching of the GC B cells from the IgG1 to the IgE producing state, which may serve as a therapeutic target for treatment of autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome and other immune disorders.|Non-Cancer
ID:31030808|Title:Rare Hereditary Hemolytic Anemias: Diagnostic Approach and Considerations in Management.Abstract:Hereditary hemolytic anemias (HHAs) comprise a heterogeneous group of anemias caused by mutations in genes coding the globins, red blood cell (RBC) membrane proteins, and RBC enzymes. Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs) are rare disorders of erythropoiesis characterized by binucleated and multinucleated erythroblasts in bone marrow. CDAs typically present with a hemolytic phenotype, as the produced RBCs have structural defects and decreased survival and should be considered in the differential of HHAs. This article discusses the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and management considerations for rare HHAs arising from unstable hemoglobins, RBC hydration defects, the less common RBC enzymopathies, and CDAs.|Non-Cancer
ID:31079897|Title:Heterozygous Variants in KMT2E Cause a Spectrum of Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Epilepsy.Abstract:We delineate a KMT2E-related neurodevelopmental disorder on the basis of 38 individuals in 36 families. This study includes 31 distinct heterozygous variants in KMT2E (28 ascertained from Matchmaker Exchange and three previously reported), and four individuals with chromosome 7q22.2-22.23 microdeletions encompassing KMT2E (one previously reported). Almost all variants occurred de novo, and most were truncating. Most affected individuals with protein-truncating variants presented with mild intellectual disability. One-quarter of individuals met criteria for autism. Additional common features include macrocephaly, hypotonia, functional gastrointestinal abnormalities, and a subtle facial gestalt. Epilepsy was present in about one-fifth of individuals with truncating variants and was responsive to treatment with anti-epileptic medications in almost all. More than 70% of the individuals were male, and expressivity was variable by sex; epilepsy was more common in females and autism more common in males. The four individuals with microdeletions encompassing KMT2E generally presented similarly to those with truncating variants, but the degree of developmental delay was greater. The group of four individuals with missense variants in KMT2E presented with the most severe developmental delays. Epilepsy was present in all individuals with missense variants, often manifesting as treatment-resistant infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Microcephaly was also common in this group. Haploinsufficiency versus gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects specific to these missense variants in KMT2E might explain this divergence in phenotype, but requires independent validation. Disruptive variants in KMT2E are an under-recognized cause of neurodevelopmental abnormalities.|Non-Cancer
ID:31127102|Title:Atomic resolution cryo-EM structure of a native-like CENP-A nucleosome aided by an antibody fragment.Abstract:Genomic DNA in eukaryotes is organized into chromatin through association with core histones to form nucleosomes, each distinguished by their DNA sequences and histone variants. Here, we used a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) derived from the anti-nucleosome antibody mAb PL2-6 to stabilize human CENP-A nucleosome containing a native alpha-satellite DNA and solved its structure by the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to 2.6 A resolution. In comparison, the corresponding cryo-EM structure of the free CENP-A nucleosome could only reach 3.4 A resolution. We find that scFv binds to a conserved acidic patch on the histone H2A-H2B dimer without perturbing the nucleosome structure. Our results provide an atomic resolution cryo-EM structure of a nucleosome and insight into the structure and function of the CENP-A nucleosome. The scFv approach is applicable to the structural determination of other native-like nucleosomes with distinct DNA sequences.|Non-Cancer
ID:31141729|Title:Facile spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy for the discrimination of alpha and beta thalassemia traits and diseases: A photodiagnosis approach.Abstract:Thalassemia (Thal) is an inherited blood disorder endemic to the Mediterranean and Middle East (e.g., KSA and UAE). This disease is caused by defects in the synthesis of one or more hemoglobin chains in red blood cells (RBCs). Alpha (alpha) Thal is caused by a reduced or absent alpha globin segment. Similarly, beta (beta) Thal is caused by a defect in the beta globin segment. We divided the diseases into four groups: alpha Thal trait, alpha Thal disease, beta Thal trait, and beta Thal disease. The alpha or beta Thal traits are milder variants of these diseases and do not require treatment; but beta Thal disease (and to a lesser extent, alpha Thal) causes hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, and bone deformities and requires repeated lifelong blood transfusions. This paper presents results regarding the identification of Thal variants using fluorescence spectroscopy of blood biomolecules and atomic force microscopy analysis of the morphologic features of red blood cells. The combined results provide new insights into the characteristics of these diseases. Furthermore, this study shows why beta Thal disease subjects are often transfusion-dependent, and alpha Thal disease subjects are only occasionally transfusion dependent.|Non-Cancer
ID:31164752|Title:PEDIA: prioritization of exome data by image analysis.Abstract:PURPOSE: Phenotype information is crucial for the interpretation of genomic variants. So far it has only been accessible for bioinformatics workflows after encoding into clinical terms by expert dysmorphologists. METHODS: Here, we introduce an approach driven by artificial intelligence that uses portrait photographs for the interpretation of clinical exome data. We measured the value added by computer-assisted image analysis to the diagnostic yield on a cohort consisting of 679 individuals with 105 different monogenic disorders. For each case in the cohort we compiled frontal photos, clinical features, and the disease-causing variants, and simulated multiple exomes of different ethnic backgrounds. RESULTS: The additional use of similarity scores from computer-assisted analysis of frontal photos improved the top 1 accuracy rate by more than 20-89% and the top 10 accuracy rate by more than 5-99% for the disease-causing gene. CONCLUSION: Image analysis by deep-learning algorithms can be used to quantify the phenotypic similarity (PP4 criterion of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines) and to advance the performance of bioinformatics pipelines for exome analysis.|Non-Cancer
ID:31168756|Title:High-Resolution Pharyngeal Manometry and Impedance: Protocols and Metrics-Recommendations of a High-Resolution Pharyngeal Manometry International Working Group.Abstract:High-resolution manometry has traditionally been utilized in gastroenterology diagnostic clinical and research applications. Recently, it is also finding new and important applications in speech pathology and laryngology practices. A High-Resolution Pharyngeal Manometry International Working Group was formed as a grass roots effort to establish a consensus on methodology, protocol, and outcome metrics for high-resolution pharyngeal manometry (HRPM) with consideration of impedance as an adjunct modality. The Working Group undertook three tasks (1) survey what experts were currently doing in their clinical and/or research practice; (2) perform a review of the literature underpinning the value of particular HRPM metrics for understanding swallowing physiology and pathophysiology; and (3) establish a core outcomes set of HRPM metrics via a Delphi consensus process. Expert survey results were used to create a recommended HRPM protocol addressing system configuration, catheter insertion, and bolus administration. Ninety two articles were included in the final literature review resulting in categorization of 22 HRPM-impedance metrics into three classes: pharyngeal lumen occlusive pressures, hypopharyngeal intrabolus pressures, and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) function. A stable Delphi consensus was achieved for 8 HRPM-Impedance metrics: pharyngeal contractile integral (CI), velopharyngeal CI, hypopharyngeal CI, hypopharyngeal pressure at nadir impedance, UES integrated relaxation pressure, relaxation time, and maximum admittance. While some important unanswered questions remain, our work represents the first step in standardization of high-resolution pharyngeal manometry acquisition, measurement, and reporting. This could potentially inform future proposals for an HRPM-based classification system specifically for pharyngeal swallowing disorders.|Non-Cancer
ID:31186072|Title:Triglyceride deposit cardiomyovasculopathy: a rare cardiovascular disorder.Abstract:Triglyceride deposit cardiomyovasculopathy (TGCV) is a phenotype primarily reported in patients carrying genetic mutations in PNPLA2 encoding adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) which releases long chain fatty acid (LCFA) as a major energy source by the intracellular TG hydrolysis. These patients suffered from intractable heart failure requiring cardiac transplantation. Moreover, we identified TGCV patients without PNPLA2 mutations based on pathological and clinical studies. We provided the diagnostic criteria, in which TGCV with and without PNPLA2 mutations were designated as primary TGCV (P-TGCV) and idiopathic TGCV (I-TGCV), respectively. We hereby report clinical profiles of TGCV patients. Between 2014 and 2018, 7 P-TGCV and 18 I-TGCV Japanese patients have been registered in the International Registry. Patients with I-TGCV, of which etiologies and causes are not known yet, suffered from adult-onset severe heart disease, including heart failure and coronary artery disease, associated with a marked reduction in ATGL activity and myocardial washout rate of LCFA tracer, as similar to those with P-TGCV. The present first registry-based study showed that TGCV is an intractable, at least at the moment, and heterogeneous cardiovascular disorder.|Non-Cancer
ID:31189917|Title:Feedback inhibition of cAMP effector signaling by a chaperone-assisted ubiquitin system.Abstract:Activation of G-protein coupled receptors elevates cAMP levels promoting dissociation of protein kinase A (PKA) holoenzymes and release of catalytic subunits (PKAc). This results in PKAc-mediated phosphorylation of compartmentalized substrates that control central aspects of cell physiology. The mechanism of PKAc activation and signaling have been largely characterized. However, the modes of PKAc inactivation by regulated proteolysis were unknown. Here, we identify a regulatory mechanism that precisely tunes PKAc stability and downstream signaling. Following agonist stimulation, the recruitment of the chaperone-bound E3 ligase CHIP promotes ubiquitylation and proteolysis of PKAc, thus attenuating cAMP signaling. Genetic inactivation of CHIP or pharmacological inhibition of HSP70 enhances PKAc signaling and sustains hippocampal long-term potentiation. Interestingly, primary fibroblasts from autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 16 (SCAR16) patients carrying germline inactivating mutations of CHIP show a dramatic dysregulation of PKA signaling. This suggests the existence of a negative feedback mechanism for restricting hormonally controlled PKA activities.|Non-Cancer
ID:31199508|Title:Identification of driver genes and somatic mutations in cell-free DNA of patients with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis.Abstract:Next-generation sequencing of cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) has emerged as promising technique for identifying minimally invasive genomic profiling of tumor cells recently. However, it remains relatively unknown in LAM disease. In our study, paired cfDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) in blood samples were obtained from 23 LAM patients and seven healthy controls to explore mutations profiles of targeted 70 cancer-related genes. As results, log2-based allele frequencies of mutations in cfDNA were significantly different from those of gDNA. By comparing the mutual mutations identified both in cfDNA and gDNA, a significant correlation was also observed. After removing mutations in gDNA, distinct somatic mutation profiles of cfDNA were observed in LAM patients. Forty of 70 targeted genes had recurrent mutations, of which ATM, BRCA2 and APC showed the highest frequency. Based on the mutation, correlation network constructed of 40 mutated genes, 11 hub genes bearing intensive interactions were highlighted, including BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD50, RB1, NF1, APC, MLH3, ATM, PDGFRA, PALB2 and BLM. Expression of the hub genes showed significant clusters between LAM patients and controls and that RAD50 and BRCA2 had the strongest associations with subject phenotypes. Myogenesis and estrogen response were confirmed to be positively regulated in LAM patients. Collectively, our study provided a landscape of genomic alterations in LAM and discovered several potential driver genes, that is, BRCA2 and RAD50, which shed a substantial light on the clinical application of key molecular markers and potential therapy targets for precision diagnosis and treatment in the future.|Non-Cancer
ID:31203817|Title:Exome sequencing in routine diagnostics: a generic test for 254 patients with primary immunodeficiencies.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) is complex and cumbersome yet important for the clinical management of the disease. Exome sequencing may provide a genetic diagnosis in a significant number of patients in a single genetic test. METHODS: In May 2013, we implemented exome sequencing in routine diagnostics for patients suffering from PIDs. This study reports the clinical utility and diagnostic yield for a heterogeneous group of 254 consecutively referred PID patients from 249 families. For the majority of patients, the clinical diagnosis was based on clinical criteria including rare and/or unusual severe bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, sometimes accompanied by autoimmune manifestations. Functional immune defects were interpreted in the context of aberrant immune cell populations, aberrant antibody levels, or combinations of these factors. RESULTS: For 62 patients (24%), exome sequencing identified pathogenic variants in well-established PID genes. An exome-wide analysis diagnosed 10 additional patients (4%), providing diagnoses for 72 patients (28%) from 68 families altogether. The genetic diagnosis directly indicated novel treatment options for 25 patients that received a diagnosis (34%). CONCLUSION: Exome sequencing as a first-tier test for PIDs granted a diagnosis for 28% of patients. Importantly, molecularly defined diagnoses indicated altered therapeutic options in 34% of cases. In addition, exome sequencing harbors advantages over gene panels as a truly generic test for all genetic diseases, including in silico extension of existing gene lists and re-analysis of existing data.|Non-Cancer
ID:31239192|Title:Moxifloxacin resistance and genotyping of Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare isolates in Japan.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Although fluoroquinolones are considered as alternative therapies of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, the association between fluoroquinolone resistance and MAC genotypes in clinical isolates from individuals not previously treated for MAC infection is not fully clear. METHODS: Totals of 154 M. avium isolates and 35 Mycobacterium intracellulare isolates were obtained from treatment-naive patients with pulmonary MAC disease at the diagnosis of MAC infection at 8 hospitals in Japan. Their susceptibilities of moxifloxacin were determined by broth microdilution methods. Moxifloxacin-resistant isolates were examined for mutations of gyrA and gyrB. Variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR) assay was performed using 15 M. avium VNTR loci and 16 M. intracellulare VNTR loci. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin susceptibility was categorized as resistant and intermediate for 6.5% and 16.9%, respectively, of M. avium isolates and 8.6% and 17.1% of M. intracellulare isolates. Although the isolates of both species had amino acid substitutions of Thr 96 and Thr 522 at the sites corresponding to Ser 95 in the M. tuberculosis GyrA and Gly 520 in the M. tuberculosis GyrB, respectively, these substitutions were observed irrespective of susceptibility and did not confer resistance. The VNTR assays showed revealed three clusters among M. avium isolates and two clusters among M. intracellulare isolates. No significant differences in moxifloxacin resistance were observed among these clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Although resistance or intermediate resistance to moxifloxacin was observed in approximately one-fourth of M. avium and M. intracellulare isolates, this resistance was not associated with mutations in gyrA and gyrB or with VNTR genotypes.|Non-Cancer
ID:31242855|Title:Using imputed whole-genome sequence data to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction for parasite resistance in Australian sheep.Abstract:BACKGROUND: This study aimed at (1) comparing the accuracies of genomic prediction for parasite resistance in sheep based on whole-genome sequence (WGS) data to those based on 50k and high-density (HD) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels; (2) investigating whether the use of variants within quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions that were selected from regional heritability mapping (RHM) in an independent dataset improved the accuracy more than variants selected from genome-wide association studies (GWAS); and (3) comparing the prediction accuracies between variants selected from WGS data to variants selected from the HD SNP panel. RESULTS: The accuracy of genomic prediction improved marginally from 0.16 +- 0.02 and 0.18 +- 0.01 when using all the variants from 50k and HD genotypes, respectively, to 0.19 +- 0.01 when using all the variants from WGS data. Fitting a GRM from the selected variants alongside a GRM from the 50k SNP genotypes improved the prediction accuracy substantially compared to fitting the 50k SNP genotypes alone. The gain in prediction accuracy was slightly more pronounced when variants were selected from WGS data compared to when variants were selected from the HD panel. When sequence variants that passed the GWAS [Formula: see text] threshold of 3 across the entire genome were selected, the prediction accuracy improved by 5% (up to 0.21 +- 0.01), whereas when selection was limited to sequence variants that passed the same GWAS [Formula: see text] threshold of 3 in regions identified by RHM, the accuracy improved by 9% (up to 0.25 +- 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that through careful selection of sequence variants from the QTL regions, the accuracy of genomic prediction for parasite resistance in sheep can be improved. These findings have important implications for genomic prediction in sheep.|Non-Cancer
ID:31269567|Title:[A clinical study of Proteus syndrome caused by a mosaic somatic mutation in AKT1 gene].Abstract:Objective: Proteus syndrome is a rare disease. The aim of the present study was to analyze the clinical characteristics and gene mutations of Proteus syndrome with a case report and relevant literature review. Methods: Clinical data of the patient with Proteus syndrome were collected in detail and biochemical measurements and radiological examinations were conducted. Tissues from phalanges with lesions were obtained to extract DNA, and Sanger sequencing of AKT1 gene was carried on. The pathogenic mutation was further tested in peripheral blood samples of the patient, his parents and 250 healthy volunteers. Orthopaedic surgery was performed on the affected limbs of the patient. Results: The patient was presented with progressive overgrowth of the right extremity, scoliosis, cerebral connective tissue nevus and lower extremity venous. A heterozygous mutation of AKT1 gene (c. 49G>A) was identified in DNA extracted from the affected bone tissue of the patient, but not be found in genomic DNA of peripheral blood samples from the patient, his parents and 250 healthy volunteers. Movement function of the affected limb improved significantly after the operations. Conclusions: The prominent features of Proteus syndrome are overgrowth of one extremity and cerebral connective tissue nevus. A mosaic somatic mutation of AKT1 gene is one of the pathogenic mutations for Proteus syndrome, and orthopedic surgery may be a good way to improve symptoms of the disease.|Non-Cancer
ID:31294066|Title:Prediction of functional consequences of the five newly discovered G6PD variations in Taiwan.Abstract:Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD deficiency; OMIM #300908) is the most common inborn error disorders worldwide. While the G6PD is the key enzyme of removing oxidative stress in erythrocytes, the early diagnosis is utmost vital to prevent chronic and drug-, food- or infection-induced hemolytic anemia. The characterization of the mutations is also important for the subsequent genetic counseling, especially for female carrier with ambiguous enzyme activities and males with mild mutations. While multiplex SNaPshot assay and Sanger sequencing were performed on 500 G6PD deficient males, five newly discovered variations, namely c.187G > A (p.E63K), c.585G > C (p.Q195H), c.586A > T (p.I196F), c.743G > A (p.G248D), and c.1330G > A (p.V444I) were detected in the other six patients. These variants were previously named as the Pingtung, Tainan, Changhua, Chiayi, and Tainan-2 variants, respectively. The in silico analysis, as well as the prediction of the structure of the resultant mutant G6PD protein indicated that these five newly discovered variants might be disease causing mutations.|Non-Cancer
ID:31350329|Title:A Pilot Study of Sirolimus in Subjects with Cowden Syndrome or Other Syndromes Characterized by Germline Mutations in PTEN.Abstract:LESSONS LEARNED: This is the first human interventional study in patients with Cowden syndrome that is driven by inactivation of germline PTEN gene.Single-agent sirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, suppressed mTOR signaling in surrogate human tissues without significant toxicity. BACKGROUND: Cowden syndrome is characterized by inactivating germline PTEN mutations, which can lead to activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. METHODS: Adult subjects with germline PTEN mutation who met international diagnostic criteria for Cowden syndrome and who had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 and adequate organ function were enrolled. Subjects were treated with a 56-day course of daily oral sirolimus. In addition to symptom assessment and physical examination, dermatologic, endoscopic, neurologic (cerebellar), and radiographic assessments were conducted. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway in benign skin and gastrointestinal (GI) lesion was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients and 16 families were enrolled. PTEN mutations were located at exons 1-8. Regression of skin and GI lesions was observed by dermoscopy or endoscopy. Neurological evaluation showed improvement in cerebellar function score at 1 month. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis in skin and GI benign lesions showed a decrease in the ratio of phosphorylated (p)S6 to total S6 in response to sirolimus. Ratios of pS6K to total S6 at days 14 and 56 were significantly lower than at baseline (p = .0026, p = .00391, respectively). A 56-day course of sirolimus was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: A 56-day course of sirolimus was well tolerated in subjects with Cowden syndrome and was associated with some evidence of improvement in symptoms, skin and GI lesions, cerebellar function, and decreased mTOR signaling.|Non-Cancer
ID:31399819|Title:Use of Mammographic Measurements to Predict Complications After Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy in BRCA Mutation Carriers.Abstract:BACKGROUND: There is limited data evaluating mastectomy skin flap complications of nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) in patients with BRCA gene mutations. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with post-operative complications in BRCA mutation carriers undergoing NSM. METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, we interrogated a prospectively collected institutional database for patients undergoing NSM who tested positive for BRCA1/2 mutations. Patient characteristics, preoperative details, and complications were evaluated. Digital mammogram was used to estimate the breast volume. RESULTS: From August 2009 to December 2017, 59 patients (2 males) with BRCA1/2 mutations underwent 114 NSMs. Ninety-two (80%) were risk-reduction surgeries. Thirty-two (28%) underwent single-stage reconstruction (24 autologous). The overall complication rate was 26.3% (N = 30), and 10.5% (N = 12) underwent unanticipated reoperation. 8.8% (N = 10) had full-thickness skin flap necrosis, 10.5% (N = 12) nipple necrosis, and 4.4% (N = 5) full-thickness nipple necrosis. These complications were associated with larger breast volume (799.4 cc vs. 544.1 cc, p < 0.001) and greater body mass index (27.8 vs. 24.3, p < 0.001). By univariate analysis, body mass index and breast volume greater than 675 cc were associated with significantly higher complication rate (odds ratios 1.2 and 4.5 respectively, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that NSM in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers is associated with complications in one in four patients. Utilizing the preoperative mammograms to estimate breast size may be more helpful than breast cup size in counseling preoperatively the risks of complications.|Non-Cancer
ID:31432761|Title:A review on protein markers of exosome from different bio-resources and the antibodies used for characterization.Abstract:Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (ranging from 30 nm to 150 nm), secreted by different cell types upon fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVB) to the cell plasma membrane under a variety of normal and pathological conditions. Through transferring their cargos such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids from donor cells to recipient cells, exosomes play a crucial role in cell-to-cell communication. Due to their presence in most body fluids (such as blood, breast milk, saliva, urine, bile, pancreatic juice, cerebrospinal and peritoneal fluids), and their role in carrying bioactive molecules from the cells of origin, exosomes have attracted great interest in their diagnostic and prognostic value for various diseases and therapeutic approaches. Although a large body of literature has documented the importance of exosomes over the past decade, there is no article systematically summarizing protein markers of exosome from different resources and the antibodies that are suited to characterize exosomes. In this review, we briefly summarize the exosome marker proteins, exosomal biomarkers for different diseases, and the antibodies suitable for different bio-resources exosomes characterization.|Non-Cancer
ID:31672142|Title:Probable progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome with immunosuppressant dose reduction following lung transplantation: a case report and literature review.Abstract:BACKGROUND: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rapidly developing demyelinating disease in the cerebral white matter and is often caused by JC polyomavirus (JCV). PML after lung transplantation is rare and has a poor prognosis, with no established therapies. Reducing the patient's immunosuppressant doses, thereby restoring immunity, could be used to treat PML. However, some patients develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with this treatment, an immune-induced inflammatory response to JCV that results in serious neuronal damage. We herein report a case of a 60-year-old female who suffered from PML 5 years after lung transplantation, had worsened brain lesions thought to be related to PML-IRIS at the time of immunosuppressant reduction, and missed treatment opportunities. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old female developed PML 5 years after lung transplantation. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple high-signal lesions, mainly in the cerebral white matter. Polymerase chain reaction found 0.32 million copies/mL of JCV in the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, she was given a diagnosis of PML. Mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus dosages were reduced, and CD4-positive cell counts and the blood concentration of each immunosuppressant were monitored. Mefloquine was also orally administered at a daily dose of 275 mg for 3 days and was then administered at a dose of 275 mg per week. Although the patient's CD4-positive cell counts increased and her immune system recovered, her symptoms and brain MRI findings worsened. We suspected PML progression or a transition to PML-IRIS. Steroid pulse therapy to suppress the inflammatory lesions was not possible but was retrospectively indicated. The patient rapidly began to exhibit akinetic mutism and died 4 months after the onset of neurologic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: When neurologic symptoms and abnormal brain MRI findings are noted during immune recovery, it is often difficult to distinguish between progressed PML and PML-IRIS. However, the pathogenesis of brain lesions usually involves inflammation and immune-reactive mechanisms for JCV. Steroid pulse therapy, which can reduce inflammation, should thus be administered in organ transplantation cases with differential diagnoses including PML-IRIS.|Non-Cancer
ID:36437532|Title:Novel Genetic Determinants of Dental Maturation in Children.Abstract:Dental occlusion requires harmonious development of teeth, jaws, and other elements of the craniofacial complex, which are regulated by environmental and genetic factors. We performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) on dental development (DD) using the Demirjian radiographic method. Radiographic assessments from participants of the Generation R Study (primary study population, <i>N</i><sub>1</sub> = 2,793; mean age of 9.8 y) were correlated with ~30 million genetic variants while adjusting for age, sex, and genomic principal components (proxy for population stratification). Variants associated with DD at genome-wide significant level (<i>P</i> < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) mapped to 16q12.2 (<i>IRX5</i>) (lead variant rs3922616, <i>B</i> = 0.16; <i>P</i> = 2.2 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). We used Fisher's combined probability tests weighted by sample size to perform a meta-analysis (<i>N</i> = 14,805) combining radiographic DD at a mean age of 9.8 y from Generation R with data from a previous GWAS (<i>N</i><sub>2</sub> = 12,012) on number of teeth (NT) in infants used as proxy of DD at a mean age of 9.8 y (including the ALSPAC and NFBC1966). This GWAS meta-analysis revealed 3 novel loci mapping to 7p15.3 (<i>IGF2BP3: P</i> = 3.2 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), 14q13.3 (<i>PAX9: P</i> = 1.9 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), and 16q12.2 (<i>IRX5: P</i> = 1.2 × 10<sup>-9</sup>) and validated 8 previously reported NT loci. A polygenic allele score constructed from these 11 loci was associated with radiographic DD in an independent Generation R set of children (<i>N</i> = 703; <i>B</i> = 0.05, <i>P</i> = 0.004). Furthermore, profiling of the identified genes across an atlas of murine and human stem cells observed expression in the cells involved in the formation of bone and/or dental tissues (>0.3 frequency per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads), likely reflecting functional specialization.

ID:36752347|Title:AD-Syn-Net: systematic identification of Alzheimer's disease-associated mutation and co-mutation vulnerabilities via deep learning.Abstract:Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most challenging neurodegenerative diseases because of its complicated and progressive mechanisms, and multiple risk factors. Increasing research evidence demonstrates that genetics may be a key factor responsible for the occurrence of the disease. Although previous reports identified quite a few AD-associated genes, they were mostly limited owing to patient sample size and selection bias. There is a lack of comprehensive research aimed to identify AD-associated risk mutations systematically. To address this challenge, we hereby construct a large-scale AD mutation and co-mutation framework ('AD-Syn-Net'), and propose deep learning models named Deep-SMCI and Deep-CMCI configured with fully connected layers that are capable of predicting cognitive impairment of subjects effectively based on genetic mutation and co-mutation profiles. Next, we apply the customized frameworks to data sets to evaluate the importance scores of the mutations and identified mutation effectors and co-mutation combination vulnerabilities contributing to cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we evaluate the influence of mutation pairs on the network architecture to dissect the genetic organization of AD and identify novel co-mutations that could be responsible for dementia, laying a solid foundation for proposing future targeted therapy for AD precision medicine. Our deep learning model codes are available open access here: https://github.com/Pan-Bio/AD-mutation-effectors.|Non-Cancer

ID:36867021|Title:FZD2 regulates limb development by mediating β-catenin-dependent and -independent Wnt signaling pathways.Abstract:Human Robinow syndrome (RS) and dominant omodysplasia type 2 (OMOD2), characterized by skeletal limb and craniofacial defects, are associated with heterozygous mutations in the Wnt receptor FZD2. However, as FZD2 can activate both canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways, its precise functions and mechanisms of action in limb development are unclear. To address these questions, we generated mice harboring a single-nucleotide insertion in Fzd2 (Fzd2em1Smill), causing a frameshift mutation in the final Dishevelled-interacting domain. Fzd2em1Smill mutant mice had shortened limbs, resembling those of RS and OMOD2 patients, indicating that FZD2 mutations are causative. Fzd2em1Smill mutant embryos displayed decreased canonical Wnt signaling in developing limb mesenchyme and disruption of digit chondrocyte elongation and orientation, which is controlled by the β-catenin-independent WNT5A/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. In line with these observations, we found that disruption of FZD function in limb mesenchyme caused formation of shortened bone elements and defects in Wnt/β-catenin and WNT5A/PCP signaling. These findings indicate that FZD2 controls limb development by mediating both canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways and reveal causality of pathogenic FZD2 mutations in RS and OMOD2 patients.|Non-Cancer

ID:36914876|Title:The genetic basis of endometriosis and comorbidity with other pain and inflammatory conditions.Abstract:Endometriosis is a common condition associated with debilitating pelvic pain and infertility. A genome-wide association study meta-analysis, including 60,674 cases and 701,926 controls of European and East Asian descent, identified 42 genome-wide significant loci comprising 49 distinct association signals. Effect sizes were largest for stage 3/4 disease, driven by ovarian endometriosis. Identified signals explained up to 5.01% of disease variance and regulated expression or methylation of genes in endometrium and blood, many of which were associated with pain perception/maintenance (SRP14/BMF, GDAP1, MLLT10, BSN and NGF). We observed significant genetic correlations between endometriosis and 11 pain conditions, including migraine, back and multisite chronic pain (MCP), as well as inflammatory conditions, including asthma and osteoarthritis. Multitrait genetic analyses identified substantial sharing of variants associated with endometriosis and MCP/migraine. Targeted investigations of genetically regulated mechanisms shared between endometriosis and other pain conditions are needed to aid the development of new treatments and facilitate early symptomatic intervention.|Non-Cancer

We developed COH04S1, a synthetic modified vaccinia Ankara vector that co-expresses Wuhan-Hu-1-based spike and nucleocapsid antigens. COH04S1 demonstrated efficacy against ancestral virus and Beta and Delta variants in animal models and was safe and immunogenic in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Here, we report efficacy of COH04S1 and analogous Omicron BA.1- and Beta-specific vaccines to protect Syrian hamsters from Omicron subvariants. Despite eliciting strain-specific antibody responses, all three vaccines protect hamsters from weight loss, lower respiratory tract infection, and lung pathology following challenge with Omicron BA.1 or BA.2.12.1. While the BA.1-specifc vaccine affords consistently improved efficacy compared to COH04S1 to protect against homologous challenge with BA.1, all three vaccines confer similar protection against heterologous challenge with BA.2.12.1. These results demonstrate efficacy of COH04S1 and variant-specific derivatives to confer cross-protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants.|Non-Cancer
ID:36932063|Title:Structural basis for antibody recognition of vulnerable epitopes on Nipah virus F protein.Abstract:Nipah virus (NiV) is a pathogenic paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in humans. Two envelope glycoproteins, the attachment protein (G/RBP) and fusion protein (F), facilitate entry into host cells. Due to its vital role, NiV F presents an attractive target for developing vaccines and therapeutics. Several neutralization-sensitive epitopes on the NiV F apex have been described, however the antigenicity of most of the F protein's surface remains uncharacterized. Here, we immunize mice with prefusion-stabilized NiV F and isolate ten monoclonal antibodies that neutralize pseudotyped virus. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals eight neutralization-sensitive epitopes on NiV F, four of which have not previously been described. Novel sites span the lateral and basal faces of NiV F, expanding the known library of vulnerable epitopes. Seven of ten antibodies bind the Hendra virus (HeV) F protein. Multiple sequence alignment suggests that some of these newly identified neutralizing antibodies may also bind F proteins across the Henipavirus genus. This work identifies new epitopes as targets for therapeutics, provides a molecular basis for NiV neutralization, and lays a foundation for development of new cross-reactive antibodies targeting Henipavirus F proteins.|Non-Cancer

ID:36951170|Title:Scalable RT-LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 testing for infection surveillance with applications in pandemic preparedness.Abstract:Throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, limited diagnostic capacities prevented sentinel testing, demonstrating the need for novel testing infrastructures. Here, we describe the setup of a cost-effective platform that can be employed in a high-throughput manner, which allows surveillance testing as an acute pandemic control and preparedness tool, exemplified by SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in an academic environment. The strategy involves self-sampling based on gargling saline, pseudonymized sample handling, automated RNA extraction, and viral RNA detection using a semiquantitative multiplexed colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay with an analytical sensitivity comparable with RT-qPCR. We provide standard operating procedures and an integrated software solution for all workflows, including sample logistics, analysis by colorimetry or sequencing, and communication of results. We evaluated factors affecting the viral load and the stability of gargling samples as well as the diagnostic sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay. In parallel, we estimated the economic costs of setting up and running the test station. We performed > 35,000 tests, with an average turnover time of < 6 h from sample arrival to result announcement. Altogether, our work provides a blueprint for fast, sensitive, scalable, cost- and labor-efficient RT-LAMP diagnostics, which is independent of potentially limiting clinical diagnostics supply chains.|Non-Cancer

It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the <i>PKLR</i> gene. Due to its rarity and clinical heterogeneity, information on the natural history and long-term clinical course of PK deficiency is limited, presenting major challenges to patient management, the development of new therapies and establishing disease-specific treatment recommendations.

The objective of this study was to develop a narrative synthesis of the findings of a systematic review of the latest case descriptions of patients with NM. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus was performed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using the keywords <i>pediatric</i>, <i>child</i>, <i>NM</i>, <i>nemaline rod</i>, and <i>rod myopathy</i>. Case studies focused on pediatric NM and published in English between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020, in order to represent the most recent findings. Information was collected about the age of first signs, earliest presenting neuromuscular signs and symptoms, systems affected, progression, death, pathologic description, and genetic changes. Of a total of 385 records, 55 case reports or series were reviewed, covering 101 pediatric patients from 23 countries. We review varying presentations in children ranging in severity despite being caused by the same mutation, in addition to current and future clinical considerations relevant to the care of patients with NM. This review synthesizes genetic, histopathologic, and disease presentation findings from pediatric NM case reports. These data strengthen our understanding of the wide spectrum of disease seen in NM. Future studies are needed to identify the underlying molecular mechanism of pathology, to improve diagnostics, and to develop better methods to improve the quality of life for these patients.|Non-Cancer
ID:36966905|Title:Persistent SARS-CoV-2-specific immune defects in kidney transplant recipients following third mRNA vaccine doses.Abstract:Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) show poorer response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, yet response patterns and mechanistic drivers following third doses are ill-defined. We administered third monovalent mRNA vaccines to n=81 KTRs with negative or low-titer anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody (n=39 anti-RBD<sup>NEG</sup>; n=42 anti-RBD<sup>LO</sup>), compared to healthy controls (HC, n=19), measuring anti-RBD, Omicron neutralization, spike-specific CD8+%, and SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. By day 30, 44% anti-RBD<sup>NEG</sup> remained seronegative; 5% KTRs developed BA.5 neutralization (versus 68% HCs, p<0.001). Day 30 spike-specific CD8+% was negative in 91% KTRs (versus 20% HCs; p=0.07), without correlation to anti-RBD (r<sub>s</sub>=0.17). Day 30 SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCR repertoires were detected in 52% KTRs versus 74% HCs (p=0.11). Spike-specific CD4+ TCR expansion was similar between KTRs and HCs, yet KTR CD8+ TCR depth was 7.6-fold lower (p=0.001). Global negative response was seen in 7% KTRs, associated with high-dose mycophenolate (p=0.037); 44% showed global positive response. 16% KTRs experienced breakthrough infections, with 2 hospitalizations; pre-breakthrough variant neutralization was poor. Absent neutralizing and CD8+ responses in KTRs indicate vulnerability to COVID-19 despite three-dose mRNA vaccination. Lack of neutralization despite CD4<sup>+</sup> expansion suggests B cell dysfunction and/or ineffective T cell help. Development of more effective KTR vaccine strategies is critical.(NCT04969263).|Non-Cancer

ID:37148359|Title:The power of TOPMed imputation for the discovery of Latino-enriched rare variants associated with type 2 diabetes.Abstract:The Latino population has been systematically underrepresented in large-scale genetic analyses, and previous studies have relied on the imputation of ungenotyped variants based on the 1000 Genomes (1000G) imputation panel, which results in suboptimal capture of low-frequency or Latino-enriched variants. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) released the largest multi-ancestry genotype reference panel representing a unique opportunity to analyse rare genetic variations in the Latino population. We hypothesise that a more comprehensive analysis of low/rare variation using the TOPMed panel would improve our knowledge of the genetics of type 2 diabetes in the Latino population.|Non-Cancer

ID:37322115|Title:Clonal hematopoiesis is associated with protection from Alzheimer's disease.Abstract:Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a premalignant expansion of mutated hematopoietic stem cells. As CHIP-associated mutations are known to alter the development and function of myeloid cells, we hypothesized that CHIP may also be associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disease in which brain-resident myeloid cells are thought to have a major role. To perform association tests between CHIP and AD dementia, we analyzed blood DNA sequencing data from 1,362 individuals with AD and 4,368 individuals without AD. Individuals with CHIP had a lower risk of AD dementia (meta-analysis odds ratio (OR) = 0.64, P = 3.8 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), and Mendelian randomization analyses supported a potential causal association. We observed that the same mutations found in blood were also detected in microglia-enriched fraction of the brain in seven of eight CHIP carriers. Single-nucleus chromatin accessibility profiling of brain-derived nuclei in six CHIP carriers revealed that the mutated cells comprised a large proportion of the microglial pool in the samples examined. While additional studies are required to validate the mechanistic findings, these results suggest that CHIP may have a role in attenuating the risk of AD.|Non-Cancer
ID:37356622|Title:An Integral Approach to the Molecular Diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: The Role of Mosaicism and Splicing Variants.Abstract:Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the presence of hamartomas in multiple organs. At the molecular level, the disease is caused by pathogenic variants in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, and only 10% to 25% of clinically diagnosed patients remain negative after multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and exon sequencing of both genes. Here, to improve the molecular diagnosis of TSC, we developed an integral approach that includes multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and deep-coverage next-generation sequencing of the entire TSC1 and TSC2 genes, along with an adapted bioinformatic pipeline to detect variants at low allele frequencies (>1%). Using this workflow, the molecular cause was identified in 29 of 42 patients with TSC, describing here, for the first time, 12 novel pathogenic variants in TSC genes. These variants included seven splicing variants, five of which were studied at the cDNA level, determining their effect on splicing. In addition, 8 of the 29 pathogenic variants were detected in mosaicism, including four patients with previous negative study results who presented extremely low mosaic variants (allele frequency, <16%). We demonstrate that this integral approach allows the molecular diagnosis of patients with TSC and improves the conventional one by adapting the technology to the detection of low-frequency mosaics.|Non-Cancer

Fifty-three unrelated patients (37 (69.8%) women, avg. age 30.2 ± 11.2 y.o.) were enrolled in the study. First-order, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM), and geometry-based statistics were calculated (3718 features per region of interest). We demonstrated imaging patterns and statistically significant differences in radiomic features potentially related to the genotype and clinical phenotype of the disease. However, the clinical utility of these patterns should be further evaluated. The study was supported by the Russian Science Foundation grant 21-15-00262.|Non-Cancer
ID:37389864|Title:ULK phosphorylation of STX17 controls autophagosome maturation via FLNA.Abstract:Autophagy is a conserved and tightly regulated intracellular quality control pathway. ULK is a key kinase in autophagy initiation, but whether ULK kinase activity also participates in the late stages of autophagy remains unknown. Here, we found that the autophagosomal SNARE protein, STX17, is phosphorylated by ULK at residue S289, beyond which it localizes specifically to autophagosomes. Inhibition of STX17 phosphorylation prevents such autophagosome localization. FLNA was then identified as a linker between ATG8 family proteins (ATG8s) and STX17 with essential involvement in STX17 recruitment to autophagosomes. Phosphorylation of STX17 S289 promotes its interaction with FLNA, activating its recruitment to autophagosomes and facilitating autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Disease-causative mutations around the ATG8s- and STX17-binding regions of FLNA disrupt its interactions with ATG8s and STX17, inhibiting STX17 recruitment and autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Cumulatively, our study reveals an unexpected role of ULK in autophagosome maturation, uncovers its regulatory mechanism in STX17 recruitment, and highlights a potential association between autophagy and FLNA.|Non-Cancer
ID:37394163|Title:An improved recombinase polymerase amplification assay for the visual detection of Staphylococcus epidermidis with lateral flow strips.Abstract:Staphylococcus epidermidis is an opportunistic pathogenic microorganism that is an important cause of cross-infection in hospitals. The development of rapid and effective detection techniques is important for its control. The application of traditional identification and PCR-based methods is limited by their requirements for both laboratory instrumentation and trained personnel. To overcome this issue, we developed a fast detection approach for S. epidermidis that was based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and lateral flow strips (LFS). First, five pairs of primers were designed for molecular diagnosis using the sesB gene as the target, and were screened for their amplification performance and the formation of primer dimers. Specific probes were then designed based on the best primer pairs screened, which were susceptible to primer-dependent artifacts and generated false-positive signals when used for LFS detection. This weakness of the LFS assay was overcome by modifying the sequences of the primers and probes. The efficacy of these measures was rigorously tested, and improved the RPA-LFS system. Standardized systems completed the amplification process within 25 min at a constant temperature of 37°C, followed by visualization of the LFS within 3 min. The approach was very sensitive (with a detection limit of 8.91 CFU/μL), with very good interspecies specificity. In the analysis of clinical samples, the approach produced results consistent with PCR and 97.78% consistent with the culture-biochemical method, with a kappa index of 0.938. Our method was rapid, accurate, and less dependent on equipment and trained personnel than traditional methods, and provided information for the timely development of rational antimicrobial treatment plans. It has high potential utility in clinical settings, particularly in resource-constrained locations.|Non-Cancer

Here, we address this bottleneck by developing a workflow combining cell-free DNA template generation, cell-free protein synthesis, and binding measurements of antibody fragments in a process that takes hours rather than weeks. We apply this workflow to evaluate 135 previously published antibodies targeting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), including all 8 antibodies previously granted emergency use authorization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and demonstrate identification of the most potent antibodies. We also evaluate 119 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from a mouse immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and identify neutralizing antibody candidates, including the antibody SC2-3, which binds the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein of all tested variants of concern. We expect that our cell-free workflow will accelerate the discovery and characterization of antibodies for future pandemics and for research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications more broadly.|Non-Cancer
ID:37402998|Title:Inhibition of TMEM16A improves cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury via preventing DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission.Abstract:Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our previous study has demonstrated that TMEM16A, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated chloride channel, contributes to renal fibrosis progression in chronic kidney disease. However, whether TMEM16A is involved in AKI is still unknown. In this study, we established cisplatin AKI mice model and found that TMEM16A expression was upregulated in the injured kidney. In vivo knockdown of TMEM16A effectively prevented cisplatin-induced tubular cell apoptosis, inflammation and kidney function loss. Western blot and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that TMEM16A knockdown inhibited Drp1 translocation from the cytoplasm to mitochondria and prevented mitochondrial fission in tubular cells. Consistently, in cultured HK2 cells, knockdown or inhibition of TMEM16A by shRNA or its specific inhibitor suppressed cisplatin-induced mitochondrial fission and its associated energy dysfunction, ROS accumulation, and cell apoptosis via inhibiting Drp1 activation. Further investigation showed that genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of TMEM16A inhibited cisplatin-induced Drp1 Ser-616 site phosphorylation through ERK1/2 signaling pathway, whereas overexpression of TMEM16A promoted this effect. Treatment with Drp1 or ERK1/2 inhibitor could efficiently prevent cisplatin-induced mitochondrial fission. Collectively, our data suggest that TMEM16A inhibition alleviated cisplatin-induced AKI by preventing tubular cell mitochondrial fission through the ERK1/2 / Drp1 pathway. Inhibition of TMEM16A may be a novel therapeutic strategy for AKI.|Non-Cancer

ID:37460897|Title:Mechanistic and evolutionary insights into a type V-M CRISPR-Cas effector enzyme.Abstract:RNA-guided type V CRISPR-Cas12 effectors provide adaptive immunity against mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in bacteria and archaea. Among diverse Cas12 enzymes, the recently identified Cas12m2 (CRISPR-Cas type V-M) is highly compact and has a unique RuvC active site. Although the non-canonical RuvC triad does not permit dsDNA cleavage, Cas12m2 still protects against invading MGEs through transcriptional silencing by strong DNA binding. However, the molecular mechanism of RNA-guided genome inactivation by Cas12m2 remains unknown. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of two states of Cas12m2-CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-target DNA ternary complexes and the Cas12m2-crRNA binary complex, revealing structural dynamics during crRNA-target DNA heteroduplex formation. The structures indicate that the non-target DNA strand is tightly bound to a unique arginine-rich cluster in the recognition (REC) domains and the non-canonical active site in the RuvC domain, ensuring strong DNA-binding affinity of Cas12m2. Furthermore, a structural comparison of Cas12m2 with TnpB, a putative ancestor of Cas12 enzymes, suggests that the interaction of the characteristic coiled-coil REC2 insertion with the protospacer-adjacent motif-distal region of the heteroduplex is crucial for Cas12m2 to engage in adaptive immunity. Collectively, our findings improve mechanistic understanding of diverse type V CRISPR-Cas effectors and provide insights into the evolution of TnpB to Cas12 enzymes.|Non-Cancer

ID:37567924|Title:Elevated binding and functional antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in infants versus mothers.Abstract:Infant antibody responses to viral infection can differ from those in adults. However, data on the specificity and function of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in infants, and direct comparisons between infants and adults are limited. Here, we characterize antibody binding and functionality against Wuhan-Hu-1 (B lineage) strain SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent plasma from 36 postpartum women and 14 of their infants infected with SARS-CoV-2 from a vaccine-naïve prospective cohort in Nairobi, Kenya. We find significantly higher antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 Spike, receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, and Spike-expressing cell-surface staining levels in infants versus mothers. Plasma antibodies from mothers and infants bind to similar regions of the Spike S2 subunit, including the fusion peptide (FP) and stem helix-heptad repeat 2. However, infants display higher antibody levels and more consistent antibody escape pathways in the FP region compared to mothers. Finally, infants have significantly higher levels of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), though, surprisingly, Spike pseudovirus neutralization titers between infants and mothers are similar. These results suggest infants develop distinct SARS-CoV-2 binding and functional antibody activities and reveal age-related differences in humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection that could be relevant to protection and COVID-19 disease outcomes.|Non-Cancer
ID:37569542|Title:Detection of Primary DNA Lesions by Transient Changes in Mating Behavior in Yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Using the Alpha-Test.Abstract:Spontaneous or induced DNA lesions can result in stable gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations due to their inaccurate repair, ultimately resulting in phenotype changes. Some DNA lesions per se may interfere with transcription, leading to temporary phenocopies of mutations. The direct impact of primary DNA lesions on phenotype before their removal by repair is not well understood. To address this question, we used the alpha-test, which allows for detecting various genetic events leading to temporary or hereditary changes in mating type α→a in heterothallic strains of yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Here, we compared yeast strains carrying mutations in DNA repair genes, mismatch repair (<i>pms1</i>), base excision repair (<i>ogg1</i>), and homologous recombination repair (<i>rad52</i>), as well as mutagens causing specific DNA lesions (UV light and camptothecin). We found that double-strand breaks and UV-induced lesions have a stronger effect on the phenotype than mismatches and 8-oxoguanine. Moreover, the loss of the entire chromosome III leads to an immediate mating type switch α→a and does not prevent hybridization. We also evaluated the ability of primary DNA lesions to persist through the cell cycle by assessing the frequency of UV-induced inherited and non-inherited genetic changes in asynchronous cultures of a wild-type (<i>wt</i>) strain and in a <i>cdc28-4</i> mutant arrested in the G1 phase.

A Scientific Statement of the Heart Failure Association of the ESC.Abstract:Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy consists in an increased LV wall thickness. LV hypertrophy can be either secondary, in response to pressure or volume overload, or primary, i.e., not explained solely by abnormal loading conditions. Primary LV hypertrophy may be due to gene mutations or to the deposition or storage of abnormal substances in the extracellular spaces or within the cardiomyocytes (more appropriately defined as pseudohypertrophy). LV hypertrophy is often a precursor to subsequent development of heart failure. Cardiovascular imaging plays a key role in the assessment of LV hypertrophy. Echocardiography, the first-line imaging technique, allows a comprehensive assessment of LV systolic and diastolic function. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance provides added value as it measures accurately LV and right ventricular volumes and mass and characterizes myocardial tissue properties, which may provide important clues to the final diagnosis. Additionally, scintigraphy with bone tracers is included in the diagnostic algorithm of cardiac amyloidosis. Once the diagnosis is established, imaging findings may help predict future disease evolution and inform therapy and follow-up. This consensus document by the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology provides an overview of the role of different cardiac imaging techniques for the differential diagnosis and management of patients with LV hypertrophy.

ID:37587458|Title:Rare disease variant curation from literature: assessing gaps with creatine transport deficiency in focus.Abstract:Approximately 4-8% of the world suffers from a rare disease. Rare diseases are often difficult to diagnose, and many do not have approved therapies. Genetic sequencing has the potential to shorten the current diagnostic process, increase mechanistic understanding, and facilitate research on therapeutic approaches but is limited by the difficulty of novel variant pathogenicity interpretation and the communication of known causative variants. It is unknown how many published rare disease variants are currently accessible in the public domain.|Non-Cancer

ID:37590348|Title:MyoD-family inhibitor proteins act as auxiliary subunits of Piezo channels.Abstract:Piezo channels are critical cellular sensors of mechanical forces. Despite their large size, ubiquitous expression, and irreplaceable roles in an ever-growing list of physiological processes, few Piezo channel-binding proteins have emerged. In this work, we found that MyoD (myoblast determination)-family inhibitor proteins (MDFIC and MDFI) are PIEZO1/2 interacting partners. These transcriptional regulators bind to PIEZO1/2 channels, regulating channel inactivation. Using single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy, we mapped the interaction site in MDFIC to a lipidated, C-terminal helix that inserts laterally into the PIEZO1 pore module. These Piezo-interacting proteins fit all the criteria for auxiliary subunits, contribute to explaining the vastly different gating kinetics of endogenous Piezo channels observed in many cell types, and elucidate mechanisms potentially involved in human lymphatic vascular disease.|Non-Cancer

Familial HLH type 3 (FHL3) accounts for ∼30% of all inborn HLH cases worldwide. It is caused by mutations in the UNC13D gene, which result in impaired degranulation of cytotoxic vesicles and hence compromised T and NK cell-mediated killing.

ID:37704779|Title:Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome: delineating the clinical and allelic spectrum in 14 new families.Abstract:Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS) is an X-linked intellectual disability syndrome caused by variants in the PHF6 gene. We ascertained 19 individuals from 15 families with likely pathogenic or pathogenic PHF6 variants (11 males and 8 females). One family had previously been reported. Six variants were novel. We analysed the clinical and genetic findings in our series and compared them with reported BFLS patients. Affected males had classic features of BFLS including intellectual disability, distinctive facies, large ears, gynaecomastia, hypogonadism and truncal obesity. Carrier female relatives of affected males were unaffected or had only mild symptoms. The phenotype of affected females with de novo variants overlapped with the males but included linear skin hyperpigmentation and a higher frequency of dental, retinal and cortical brain anomalies. Complications observed in our series included keloid scarring, digital fibromas, absent vaginal orifice, neuropathy, umbilical hernias, and talipes. Our analysis highlighted sex-specific differences in PHF6 variant types and locations. Affected males often have missense variants or small in-frame deletions while affected females tend to have truncating variants or large deletions/duplications. Missense variants were found in a minority of affected females and clustered in the highly constrained PHD2 domain of PHF6. We propose recommendations for the evaluation and management of BFLS patients. These results further delineate and extend the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of BFLS.|Non-Cancer

ID:37751797|Title:Reassessment of the NF1 variants of unknown significance found during the 20-year activity of a genetics diagnostic laboratory.Abstract:The finding of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in the activity of a diagnostic genetic laboratory is a common issue, which is however provisional and needs to be periodically re-evaluated, due to the continuous advancements in our knowledge of the genetic diseases. Neurofibromatosis type 1, caused by the occurrence of heterozygous pathogenic NF1 variants, is a good model for studying the evolution of VUS, due to the widespread use of genetic testing for the disease, the constant enrichment of the international databases with NF1 variants and the full adult penetrance of the disease, which makes genotyping the parents a crucial step in the diagnostic workflow. The present study retrospectively reviewed and reinterpreted the genetic test results of NF1 in a diagnostic genetic laboratory in the period from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2020. All the VUS were reinterpreted using the 2015 consensus standards and guidelines for the interpretation. Out of 589 NF1 genetic tests which were performed in the period, a total of 85 VUS were found and reinterpreted in 72 cases (84.7%): 21 (29.2%) were reclassified as benign/likely benign, whereas 51 (70.8%) were recoded as pathogenic/likely pathogenic with a significant trend distribution (Chi square test for trend p = 0.005). Synonymous VUS have mainly been reclassified as class 1 and 2 (7/8, 87.5%), whereas missense variants have been attributed to class 4 and 5 in 38 out of the 58 cases (65.5%). These findings underline an improvement in the classification of variants over time, suggesting that a reinterpretation of the genetic tests should be routinely performed to support the physicians in the clinical diagnosis of genetic diseases.|Non-Cancer
ID:37801091|Title:Symptomatic intraventricular choroid plexus cysts. Illustrative case and systematic review.Abstract:Although choroid plexus cysts are a frequent incidental neuroimaging finding, symptomatic ones are rare-a series of more than five cases are hard to find. In the absence of high-volume studies, there are no generally accepted algorithms for diagnosis and treatment for this pathology. Proposed surgical techniques include microsurgical excision or fenestration and endoscopic excision or fenestration with or without additional shunting. No definitive conclusions exist about the superiority of a certain technique. Here, we introduce an illustrative case of a patient with a symptomatic choroid plexus cyst in the trigone of the lateral ventricle and a systematic review of 65 additional published cases with the aim of identifying epidemiological features, variants of localization of the cysts, their symptoms, persistence of concomitant obstructive hydrocephalus, and treatment modalities. A PRISMA-based literature search was performed on the PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge databases. We include in the review case reports and case series of symptomatic choroid plexus cysts with full texts or valuable abstracts available online in English and published by April 2023. All abstracts of retrieved studies were assessed by two independent researchers to avoid bias. Only descriptive statistics were used for the presentation of the results. A total of 48 studies (39 case reports and 9 case series) with 65 depicted cases met the eligibility criteria. The review showed a slight predominance of choroid plexus cysts in men. The most common localizations of cysts were the trigone and the body of the lateral ventricle. Obstructive hydrocephalus is often present in patients with choroid plexus cysts. The most common symptoms of cysts were signs of increased ICP: headaches and vomiting. The main treatment approaches for symptomatic choroid plexus cysts were microsurgical excision, microsurgical fenestration, endoscopic fenestration, and total endoscopic excision. The tendency has been noted to shift from microsurgical to endoscopic procedures over the past two decades. Some data on the classification of cysts of the central nervous system and the underlying mechanisms of the pathogenesis of choroid plexus cysts are also presented.Although symptomatic cases of choroid plexus cysts are rare, by summarizing currently available data, one could clarify their common features and identify a preferable treatment modality.|Non-Cancer
ID:37864100|Title:Risk factors for early mortality in elderly patients with unstable isolated C2 odontoid fracture treated with halo-vest or surgery.Abstract:The aim of this study was to compare in-hospital mortality of three procedures -halo-vest immobilization, anterior spinal fixation (ASF), and posterior spinal fixation (PSF)- in the treatment of elderly patients with isolated C2 odontoid fracture. We extracted data for elderly patients who were admitted with C2 odontoid fracture and treated with at least one of the three procedures (halo-vest immobilization, ASF, or PSF) during hospitalization. We conducted a generalized propensity score-based matching weight analysis to compare in-hospital mortality among the three procedures. We further investigated independent risk factors for in-hospital death. The study involved 891 patients (halo-vest, n = 463; ASF, n = 74; and PSF, n = 354) with a mean age of 78 years. In-hospital death occurred in 45 (5.1%) patients. Treatment type was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. Male sex (odds ratio 2.98; 95% confidence interval 1.32-6.73; p = 0.009) and a Charlson comorbidity index of ≥ 3 (odds ratio 9.18; 95% confidence interval 3.25-25.92; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. In conclusion, treatment type was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in elderly patients with isolated C2 odontoid fracture. Halo-vest immobilization can help to avoid adverse events in patients with C2 odontoid fracture who are considered less suitable for surgical treatment.|Non-Cancer

ID:37873196|Title:Exome copy number variant detection, analysis and classification in a large cohort of families with undiagnosed rare genetic disease.Abstract:Copy number variants (CNVs) are significant contributors to the pathogenicity of rare genetic diseases and with new innovative methods can now reliably be identified from exome sequencing. Challenges still remain in accurate classification of CNV pathogenicity. CNV calling using GATK-gCNV was performed on exomes from a cohort of 6,633 families (15,759 individuals) with heterogeneous phenotypes and variable prior genetic testing collected at the Broad Institute Center for Mendelian Genomics of the GREGoR consortium. Each family's CNV data was analyzed using the <i>seqr</i> platform and candidate CNVs classified using the 2020 ACMG/ClinGen CNV interpretation standards. We developed additional evidence criteria to address situations not covered by the current standards. The addition of CNV calling to exome analysis identified causal CNVs for 173 families (2.6%). The estimated sizes of CNVs ranged from 293 bp to 80 Mb with estimates that 44% would not have been detected by standard chromosomal microarrays. The causal CNVs consisted of 141 deletions, 15 duplications, 4 suspected complex structural variants (SVs), 3 insertions and 10 complex SVs, the latter two groups being identified by orthogonal validation methods. We interpreted 153 CNVs as likely pathogenic/pathogenic and 20 CNVs as high interest variants of uncertain significance. Calling CNVs from existing exome data increases the diagnostic yield for individuals undiagnosed after standard testing approaches, providing a higher resolution alternative to arrays at a fraction of the cost of genome sequencing. Our improvements to the classification approach advances the systematic framework to assess the pathogenicity of CNVs.|Non-Cancer
ID:37888959|Title:<i>Candida albicans</i> exhibits heterogeneous and adaptive cytoprotective responses to antifungal compounds.Abstract:<i>Candida albicans,</i> an opportunistic human pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health and is associated with significant socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments fail, at least in part, because <i>C. albicans</i> can initiate a strong drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory concentration. To better characterize this cytoprotective tolerance program at the molecular single-cell level, we used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish their subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage with distinct metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure (a time when tolerance is measurable), surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations: one characterized by the upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, rRNA processing machinery, and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity, termed the Ribo-dominant (<i>Rd</i>) state; and the other enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes, termed the Stress-dominant (<i>Sd</i>) state. This bifurcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment. We provide evidence that the ribosome assembly stress response (RASTR) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival.|Non-Cancer
ID:37888995|Title:CRISPR-based diagnostics detects invasive insect pests.Abstract:Rapid identification of organisms is essential for many biological and medical disciplines, from understanding basic ecosystem processes, disease diagnosis, to the detection of invasive pests. CRISPR-based diagnostics offers a novel and rapid alternative to other identification methods and can revolutionize our ability to detect organisms with high accuracy. Here we describe a CRISPR-based diagnostic developed with the universal cytochrome-oxidase 1 gene (CO1). The CO1 gene is the most sequenced gene among Animalia, and therefore our approach can be adopted to detect nearly any animal. We tested the approach on three difficult-to-identify moth species (Keiferia lycopersicella, Phthorimaea absoluta and Scrobipalpa atriplicella) that are major invasive pests globally. We designed an assay that combines recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) with CRISPR for signal generation. Our approach has a much higher sensitivity than real-time PCR assays and achieved 100% accuracy for identification of all three species, with a detection limit of up to 120 fM for P. absoluta and 400 fM for the other two species. Our approach does not require a sophisticated laboratory, reduces the risk of cross-contamination, and can be completed in less than 1 h. This work serves as a proof of concept that has the potential to revolutionize animal detection and monitoring.|Non-Cancer
ID:37892108|Title:Characterization of New Alpha Zero (α<sup>0</sup>) Thalassaemia Deletion (--<sup>GB</sup>) among Malays in Malaysian Population.Abstract:Malaysia is a multicultural and multiethnic country comprising numerous ethnic groups. From the total population of 32.7 million, Malays form the bulk of the Bumiputera in Malaysia comprise about 69.9%, followed by Chinese 22.8%, Indian 6.6%, and others 0.7%. The heterogeneous population and increasing numbers of non-citizens in this country affects the heterogeneity of genetic diseases, diversity, and heterogeneity of thalassaemia mutations. Alpha (α)-thalassaemia is an inherited haemoglobin disorder characterized by hypochromic microcytic anaemia caused by a quantitative reduction in the α-globin chain. A majority of the α-thalassaemia are caused by deletions in the α-globin gene cluster. Among Malays, the most common deletional alpha thalassaemia is -α<sup>3.7</sup> deletion followed by --<sup>SEA</sup> deletion. We described the molecular characterization of a new --<sup>GB</sup> deletion in our population, involving both alpha genes in <i>cis</i>. Interestingly, we found that this mutation is unique among Malay ethnicities. It is important to diagnose this deletion because of the 25% risk of Hb Bart's with hydrops fetalis in the offspring when in combination with another α<sup>0</sup>- thalassaemia allele. MLPA is a suitable method to detect unknown and uncommon deletions and to characterize those cases which remain unresolved after a standard diagnostic approach.|Non-Cancer
ID:37901227|Title:Significance of HLA-E and its two NKG2 receptors in development of complications after allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells.Abstract:Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT) is a procedure commonly used in treatment of various haematological disorders which is associated with significantly improved survival rates. However, one of its drawbacks is the possibility of development of post-transplant complications, including acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or CMV infection. Various studies suggested that NK cells and their receptors may affect the transplant outcome. In the present study, patients and donors were found to significantly differ in the distribution of the <i>NKG2A</i> rs7301582 genetic variants - recipients carried the <i>C</i> allele more often than their donors (0.975 vs 0.865, p<0.0001). Increased soluble HLA-E (sHLA-E) levels detected in recipients' serum 30 days after transplantation seemed to play a prognostic and protective role. It was observed that recipients with higher sHLA-E levels were less prone to chronic GvHD (11.65 vs 6.33 pg/mL, p=0.033) or more severe acute GvHD grades II-IV (11.07 vs 8.04 pg/mL, p=0.081). Our results also showed an unfavourable role of HLA-E donor-recipient genetic incompatibility in CMV infection development after transplantation (OR=5.92, p=0.014). Frequencies of NK cells (both CD56dim and CD56bright) expressing NKG2C were elevated in recipients who developed CMV, especially 30 and 90 days post-transplantation (p<0.03). Percentages of NKG2C+ NK cells lacking NKG2A expression were also increased in these patients. Moreover, recipients carrying a <i>NKG2C</i> deletion characterized with decreased frequency of NKG2C+ NK cells (p<0.05). Our study confirms the importance of NK cells in the development of post-transplant complications and highlights the effect of HLA-E and NKG2C genetic variants, sHLA-E serum concentration, as well as NKG2C surface expression on transplant outcome.|Non-Cancer
ID:37904051|Title:Mosaic chromosomal alterations in blood across ancestries using whole-genome sequencing.Abstract:Megabase-scale mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) in blood are prognostic markers for a host of human diseases. Here, to gain a better understanding of mCA rates in genetically diverse populations, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 67,390 individuals from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program. We observed higher sensitivity with whole-genome sequencing data, compared with array-based data, in uncovering mCAs at low mutant cell fractions and found that individuals of European ancestry have the highest rates of autosomal mCAs and the lowest rates of chromosome X mCAs, compared with individuals of African or Hispanic ancestry. Although further studies in diverse populations will be needed to replicate our findings, we report three loci associated with loss of chromosome X, associations between autosomal mCAs and rare variants in DCPS, ADM17, PPP1R16B and TET2 and ancestry-specific variants in ATM and MPL with mCAs in cis.|Non-Cancer
ID:37907381|Title:Variant Classification for Pompe disease; ACMG/AMP specifications from the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases Variant Curation Expert Panel.Abstract:Accurate determination of the clinical significance of genetic variants is critical to the integration of genomics in medicine. To facilitate this process, the NIH-funded Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) has assembled Variant Curation Expert Panels (VCEPs), groups of experts and biocurators which provide gene- and disease- specifications to the American College of Medical Genetics & Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology's (ACMG/AMP) variation classification guidelines. With the goal of classifying the clinical significance of GAA variants in Pompe disease (Glycogen storage disease, type II), the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases (LD) VCEP has specified the ACMG/AMP criteria for GAA. Variant classification can play an important role in confirming the diagnosis of Pompe disease as well as in the identification of carriers. Furthermore, since the inclusion of Pompe disease on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) for newborns in the USA in 2015, the addition of molecular genetic testing has become an important component in the interpretation of newborn screening results, particularly for asymptomatic individuals. To date, the LD VCEP has submitted classifications and supporting data on 243 GAA variants to public databases, specifically ClinVar and the ClinGen Evidence Repository. Here, we describe the ACMG/AMP criteria specification process for GAA, an update of the GAA-specific variant classification guidelines, and comparison of the ClinGen LD VCEP's GAA variant classifications with variant classifications submitted to ClinVar. The LD VCEP has added to the publicly available knowledge on the pathogenicity of variants in GAA by increasing the number of expert-curated GAA variants present in ClinVar, and aids in resolving conflicting classifications and variants of uncertain clinical significance.|Non-Cancer
ID:37909662|Title:SMURF1 controls the PPP3/calcineurin complex and TFEB at a regulatory node for lysosomal biogenesis.Abstract:Macroautophagy/autophagy is a homeostatic process in response to multiple signaling, such as the lysosome-dependent recycling process of cellular components. Starvation-induced MTOR inactivation and PPP3/calcineurin activation were shown to promote the nuclear translocation of TFEB. However, the mechanisms via which signals from endomembrane damage are transmitted to activate PPP3/calcineurin and orchestrate autophagic responses remain unknown. This study aimed to show that autophagy regulator SMURF1 controlled TFEB nuclear import for transcriptional activation of the lysosomal biogenesis. We showed that blocking SMURF1 affected lysosomal biogenesis in response to lysosomal damage by preventing TFEB nuclear translocation. It revealed galectins recognized endolysosomal damage, and led to recruitment of SMURF1 and the PPP3/calcineurin apparatus on lysosomes. SMURF1 interacts with both LGALS3 and PPP3CB to form the LGALS3-SMURF1-PPP3/calcineurin complex. Importantly, this complex further stabilizes TFEB, thereby activating TFEB for lysosomal biogenesis. We determined that LLOMe-mediated TFEB nuclear import is dependent on SMURF1 under the condition of MTORC1 inhibition. In addition, SMURF1 is required for PPP3/calcineurin activity as a positive regulator of TFEB. SMURF1 controlled the phosphatase activity of the PPP3CB by promoting the dissociation of its autoinhibitory domain (AID) from its catalytic domain (CD). Overexpression of SMURF1 showed similar effects as the constitutive activation of PPP3CB. Thus, SMURF1, which bridges environmental stress with the core autophagosomal and autolysosomal machinery, interacted with endomembrane sensor LGALS3 and phosphatase PPP3CB to control TFEB activation.<b>Abbreviations</b>: ATG: autophagy-related; LLOMe: L-Leucyl-L-Leucine methyl ester; ML-SA1: mucolipin synthetic agonist 1; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; PPP3CB: protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit beta; RPS6KB1/p70S6K: ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1; SMURF1: SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB.|Non-Cancer
ID:37931130|Title:Sequence basis for selectivity of ephrin-B2 ligand for Eph receptors and pathogenic henipavirus G glycoproteins.Abstract:Ephrin-B2 (EFNB2) is a ligand for six Eph receptors in humans and functions as a cell entry receptor for several henipaviruses including the Nipah virus (NiV), a pathogenic zoonotic virus with pandemic potential. To understand the sequence basis of promiscuity for EFNB2 binding to the attachment glycoprotein of NiV (NiV-G) and Eph receptors, we performed deep mutagenesis on EFNB2 to identify mutations that enhance binding to NiV-G over EphB2, one of the highest affinity Eph receptors. The mutations highlight how different EFNB2 conformations are selected by NiV-G versus EphB2. Specificity mutations are enriched at the base of the G-H binding loop of EFNB2, especially surrounding a phenylalanine hinge upon which the G-H loop pivots, and at a phenylalanine hook that rotates away from the EFNB2 core to engage Eph receptors. One EFNB2 mutant, D62Q, possesses pan-specificity to the attachment glycoproteins of closely related henipaviruses and has markedly diminished binding to the six Eph receptors. However, EFNB2-D62Q has high residual binding to EphB3 and EphB4. A second deep mutational scan of EFNB2 identified combinatorial mutations to further enhance specificity to NiV-G. A triple mutant of soluble EFNB2, D62Q-Q130L-V167L, has minimal binding to Eph receptors but maintains binding, albeit reduced, to NiV-G. Soluble EFNB2 decoy receptors carrying the specificity mutations were potent neutralizers of chimeric henipaviruses. These findings demonstrate how specific residue changes at the shared binding interface of a promiscuous ligand (EFNB2) can influence selectivity for multiple receptors, and may also offer insight toward the development of henipavirus therapeutics and diagnostics. IMPORTANCE Ephrin-B2 (EFNB2) is a ligand for six Eph receptors in humans and regulates multiple cell developmental and signaling processes. It also functions as the cell entry receptor for Nipah virus and Hendra virus, zoonotic viruses that can cause respiratory and/or neurological symptoms in humans with high mortality. Here, we investigate the sequence basis of EFNB2 specificity for binding the Nipah virus attachment G glycoprotein over Eph receptors. We then use this information to engineer EFNB2 as a soluble decoy receptor that specifically binds the attachment glycoproteins of the Nipah virus and other related henipaviruses to neutralize infection. These findings further mechanistic understanding of protein selectivity and may facilitate the development of diagnostics or therapeutics against henipavirus infection.|Non-Cancer
ID:37938781|Title:Autoantibodies against type I IFNs in humans with alternative NF-κB pathway deficiency.Abstract:Patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1 (APS-1) caused by autosomal recessive AIRE deficiency produce autoantibodies that neutralize type I interferons (IFNs)<sup>1,2</sup>, conferring a predisposition to life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia<sup>3</sup>. Here we report that patients with autosomal recessive NIK or RELB deficiency, or a specific type of autosomal-dominant NF-κB2 deficiency, also have neutralizing autoantibodies against type I IFNs and are at higher risk of getting life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. In patients with autosomal-dominant NF-κB2 deficiency, these autoantibodies are found only in individuals who are heterozygous for variants associated with both transcription (p52 activity) loss of function (LOF) due to impaired p100 processing to generate p52, and regulatory (IκBδ activity) gain of function (GOF) due to the accumulation of unprocessed p100, therefore increasing the inhibitory activity of IκBδ (hereafter, p52<sup>LOF</sup>/IκBδ<sup>GOF</sup>). By contrast, neutralizing autoantibodies against type I IFNs are not found in individuals who are heterozygous for NFKB2 variants causing haploinsufficiency of p100 and p52 (hereafter, p52<sup>LOF</sup>/IκBδ<sup>LOF</sup>) or gain-of-function of p52 (hereafter, p52<sup>GOF</sup>/IκBδ<sup>LOF</sup>). In contrast to patients with APS-1, patients with disorders of NIK, RELB or NF-κB2 have very few tissue-specific autoantibodies. However, their thymuses have an abnormal structure, with few AIRE-expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells. Human inborn errors of the alternative NF-κB pathway impair the development of AIRE-expressing medullary thymic epithelial cells, thereby underlying the production of autoantibodies against type I IFNs and predisposition to viral diseases.|Non-Cancer

ID:37994469|Title:Investigation of <i>BAK</i>, <i>BAX</i> and <i>MAD2L1 g</i>ene expression in human aneuploid blastocysts.Abstract:Maintaining genomic stability is crucial for normal development. At earlier stages of preimplantation development, as the embryonic genome activation is not fully completed, the embryos may be more prone to abnormalities. Aneuploidies are one of the most common genetic causes of implantation failure or first-trimester miscarriages. Apoptosis is a crucial mechanism to eliminate damaged or abnormal cells from the organism to enable healthy growth. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the relationship between the expression levels of genes involved in apoptosis in human aneuploid and euploid blastocysts. In total, 32 human embryos obtained from 21 patients were used for this study. Trophectoderm biopsies were performed and next-generation screening was carried out for aneuploidy screening. Total RNA was extracted from each blastocyst separately and cDNA was synthesized. Gene expression levels were evaluated using RT-PCR. The statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the gene expression level variations in the euploid and aneuploid embryos, respectively. The expression level of the <i>BAX</i> gene was significantly different between the aneuploid and euploid samples. BAX expression levels were found to be 1.5-fold lower in aneuploid cells. However, the expression levels of <i>BAK</i> and <i>MAD2L1</i> genes were similar in each group. This study aimed to investigate the possible role of genes involved in apoptosis and aneuploidy mechanisms. The findings of this investigation revealed that the <i>BAX</i> gene was expressed significantly differently between aneuploid and euploid embryos. Therefore, it is possible that the genes involved in the apoptotic pathway have a role in the aneuploidy mechanism.|Non-Cancer

The pathogenesis of PJS remains unclear; however, it may be associated with mutations in the STK11 gene, and there is currently no effective treatment available. The gut microbiota plays an important role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis in the human body, and an increasing number of studies have reported a relationship between gut microbiota and human health and disease. However, relatively few studies have been conducted on the gut microbiota characteristics of patients with PJS. In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of the gut microbiota of 79 patients with PJS using 16 S sequencing and measured the levels of short-chain fatty acids in the intestines. The results showed dysbiosis in the gut microbiota of patients with PJS, and decreased synthesis of short-chain fatty acids. Bacteroides was positively correlated with maximum polyp length, while Agathobacter was negatively correlated with age of onset. In addition, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid were positively correlated with the age of onset but negatively correlated with the number of polyps. Furthermore, the butyric acid level was negatively correlated with the frequency of endoscopic surgeries. In contrast, we compared the gut microbiota of STK11-positive and STK11-negative patients with PJS for the first time, but 16 S sequencing analysis revealed no significant differences. Finally, we established a random forest prediction model based on the gut microbiota characteristics of patients to provide a basis for the targeted diagnosis and treatment of PJS in the future.|Non-Cancer
ID:38040034|Title:Neurological disease in xeroderma pigmentosum: prospective cohort study of its features and progression.Abstract:Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) results from biallelic mutations in any of eight genes involved in DNA repair systems, thus defining eight different genotypes (XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPE, XPF, XPG and XP variant or XPV). In addition to cutaneous and ophthalmological features, some patients present with XP neurological disease. It is unknown whether the different neurological signs and their progression differ among groups. Therefore, we aim to characterize the XP neurological disease and its evolution in the heterogeneous UK XP cohort. Patients with XP were followed in the UK National XP Service, from 2009 to 2021. Age of onset for different events was recorded. Cerebellar ataxia and additional neurological signs and symptoms were rated with the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS) and the Activities of Daily Living questionnaire (ADL). Patients' mutations received scores based on their predicted effects. Data from available ancillary tests were collected. Ninety-three XP patients were recruited. Thirty-six (38.7%) reported neurological symptoms, especially in the XPA, XPD and XPG groups, with early-onset and late-onset forms, and typically appearing after cutaneous and ophthalmological symptoms. XPA, XPD and XPG patients showed higher SARA scores compared to XPC, XPE and XPV. SARA total scores significantly increased over time in XPD (0.91 points/year, 95% confidence interval: 0.61, 1.21) and XPA (0.63 points/year, 95% confidence interval: 0.38, 0.89). Hyporeflexia, hypopallesthaesia, upper motor neuron signs, chorea, dystonia, oculomotor signs and cognitive impairment were frequent findings in XPA, XPD and XPG. Cerebellar and global brain atrophy, axonal sensory and sensorimotor neuropathies, and sensorineural hearing loss were common findings in patients. Some XPC, XPE and XPV cases presented with abnormalities on examination and/or ancillary tests, suggesting underlying neurological involvement. More severe mutations were associated with a faster progression in SARA total score in XPA (0.40 points/year per 1-unit increase in severity score) and XPD (0.60 points/year per 1-unit increase), and in ADL total score in XPA (0.35 points/year per 1-unit increase). Symptomatic and asymptomatic forms of neurological disease are frequent in XP patients, and neurological symptoms can be an important cause of disability. Typically, the neurological disease will be preceded by cutaneous and ophthalmological features, and these should be actively searched in patients with idiopathic late-onset neurological syndromes. Scales assessing cerebellar function, especially walking and speech, and disability can show progression in some of the groups. Mutation severity can be used as a prognostic biomarker for stratification purposes in clinical trials.|Non-Cancer

ID:38052076|Title:Discriminative fusion of moments-aligned latent representation of multimodality medical data.Abstract:Fusion of multimodal medical data provides multifaceted, disease-relevant information for diagnosis or prognosis prediction modeling. Traditional fusion strategies such as feature concatenation often fail to learn hidden complementary and discriminative manifestations from high-dimensional multimodal data. To this end, we proposed a methodology for the integration of multimodality medical data by matching their moments in a latent space, where the hidden, shared information of multimodal data is gradually learned by optimization with multiple feature collinearity and correlation constrains. We first obtained the multimodal hidden representations by learning mappings between the original domain and shared latent space. Within this shared space, we utilized several relational regularizations, including data attribute preservation, feature collinearity and feature-task correlation, to encourage learning of the underlying associations inherent in multimodal data. The fused multimodal latent features were finally fed to a logistic regression classifier for diagnostic prediction. Extensive evaluations on three independent clinical datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in fusing multimodal data for medical prediction modeling.&#xD.|Non-Cancer
ID:38057384|Title:Mutational spectrum and phenotypic variability of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and related disorders in a Bangladeshi population.Abstract:Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe rare neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked dystrophin gene. Several mutations have been identified, yet the full mutational spectrum, and their phenotypic consequences, will require genotyping across different populations. To this end, we undertook the first detailed genotype and phenotype characterization of DMD in the Bangladeshi population. We investigated the rare mutational and phenotypic spectrum of the DMD gene in 36 DMD-suspected Bangladeshi participants using an economically affordable diagnostic strategy involving initial screening for exonic deletions in the DMD gene via multiplex PCR, followed by testing PCR-negative patients for mutations using whole exome sequencing. The deletion mapping identified two critical DMD gene hotspot regions (near proximal and distal ends, spanning exons 8-17 and exons 45-53, respectively) that comprised 95% (21/22) of the deletions for this population cohort. From our exome analysis, we detected two novel pathogenic hemizygous mutations in exons 21 and 42 of the DMD gene, and novel pathogenic recessive and loss of function variants in four additional genes: SGCD, DYSF, COL6A3, and DOK7. Our phenotypic analysis showed that DMD suspected participants presented diverse phenotypes according to the location of the mutation and which gene was impacted. Our study provides ethnicity specific new insights into both clinical and genetic aspects of DMD.|Non-Cancer

Clinically, autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease is characterized by vast heterogeneity, ranging from asymptomatic to highly symptomatic hepatomegaly. To date, little is known about the prediction of disease progression at early stages, hindering clinical management, genetic counseling, and the design of randomized controlled trials. To improve disease prognostication, we built a consortium of European and US centers to recruit the largest cohort of patients with PRKCSH and SEC63 liver disease.|Non-Cancer
ID:38103548|Title:ClinGen guidance for use of the PP1/BS4 co-segregation and PP4 phenotype specificity criteria for sequence variant pathogenicity classification.Abstract:The 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology variant classification publication established a standard employed internationally to guide laboratories in variant assessment. Those recommendations included both pathogenic (PP1) and benign (BS4) criteria for evaluating the inheritance patterns of variants, but details of how to apply those criteria at appropriate evidence levels were sparse. Several publications have since attempted to provide additional guidance, but anecdotally, this issue is still challenging. Additionally, it is not clear that those prior efforts fully distinguished disease-gene identification considerations from variant pathogenicity considerations nor did they address autosomal-recessive and X-linked inheritance. Here, we have taken a mixed inductive and deductive approach to this problem using real diseases as examples. We have developed a practical heuristic for genetic co-segregation evidence and have also determined that the specific phenotype criterion (PP4) is inseparably coupled to the co-segregation criterion. We have also determined that negative evidence at one locus constitutes positive evidence for other loci for disorders with locus heterogeneity. Finally, we provide a points-based system for evaluating phenotype and co-segregation as evidence types to support or refute a locus and show how that can be integrated into the Bayesian framework now used for variant classification and consistent with the 2015 guidelines.|Non-Cancer
ID:38168382|Title:Unravelling the complexities of DNA-PK activation by structure-based mutagenesis.Abstract:It has been known for decades that the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is only an active serine/threonine protein kinase when it is bound to a DNA double-stranded end; still, the molecular details of how this activation is achieved have remained elusive. The recent surge in structural information for DNA-PK complexes has provided valuable insights into the process of DNA end recognition by DNA-PK. A particularly intriguing feature of this kinase is a region of the protein that can transition from a seemingly structurally disordered state to a single alpha-helix that traverses down the DNA binding cradle. The DNA-PK bound DNA end of the DNA substrate engages with and appears to split around this helix which has been named the <b>D</b>NA <b>E</b>nd <b>B</b>locking helix (DEB). Here a mutational approach is utilized to clarify the role of the DEB, and how DNA ends activate the enzyme. Our data suggest two distinct methods of kinase activation that is dependent on the DNA end chemistry. If the DNA end can split around the helix and stabilize the interaction between the DNA end and the DEB with a recently defined <b>H</b>elix-<b>H</b>airpin-<b>H</b>elix (HHH) motif, the kinase forms an end-protection monomer that is active towards DNA-PK's many substrates. But if the DNA end cannot stably interact with the DEB [because of the DNA end structure, for instance hairpins, or because the DEB has been disrupted by mutation], the kinase is only partially activated, resulting in specific autophosphorylations of the DNA-PK monomer that allows nucleolytic end-processing. We posit that mutants that disrupt the capacity to stably generate the DEB/HHH DNA end-interaction are inefficient in generating the dimer complex that is requisite for NHEJ. In support of this idea, mutations that promote formation of this dimer partially rescue the severe cellular phenotypes associated with mutation of the DEB helix.|Non-Cancer

ID:38182630|Title:Biomarkers of axonal damage to favor early diagnosis in variant transthyretin amyloidosis (A-ATTRv).Abstract:Early identification of ATTRv amyloidosis disease onset is still often delayed due to the lack of validated biomarkers of this disease. Light chain neurofilament (NfL) have shown promising results in early diagnosis in this disease, but data is still needed, including with alternative measuring methods. Our aim was to study the levels of NfL measured by ELISA. Furthermore, interstitial matrix metalloproteinase type 1 (MMP-1) serum levels were measured as a potential new biomarker in ATTRv. Serum NfL and MMP-1 were measured using ELISA assays in 90 participants (29 ATTR-V30M patients, 31 asymptomatic V30M-TTR variant carriers and 30 healthy controls). Median NfL levels among ATTRv amyloidosis patients were significantly higher (116 pg/mL vs 0 pg/mL in both comparison groups). The AUC comparing ATTRv amyloidosis patients and asymptomatic carriers was 0.90 and the NfL concentration of 93.55 pg/mL yielded a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 87%. NfL levels had a significant positive correlation with NIS values among patients. We found a negative significant correlation between eGFR and NfL levels. Finally, MMP1 levels were not different between groups. Evidence of NfL use for early diagnosis of ATTR-PN amyloidosis is growing. ELISA seems a reliable and available technique for it quantification. Decreased GFR could influence NfL plasma levels.|Non-Cancer
ID:38186869|Title:DKK3 as a potential novel biomarker in patients with autosomal polycystic kidney disease.Abstract:Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disease, and leads to a steady loss of kidney function in adulthood. The variable course of the disease makes it necessary to identify the patients with rapid disease progression who will benefit the most from targeted therapies and interventions. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging-based volumetry of the kidney is the most commonly used tool for this purpose. Biomarkers that can be easily and quantitatively determined, which allow a prediction of the loss of kidney function, have not yet been established in clinical practice. The glycoprotein Dickkopf 3 (DKK3) which is secreted in the renal tubular epithelium upon stress and contributes to tubulointerstitial fibrosis via the <i>Wnt</i> signaling pathway, was recently described as a biomarker for estimating risk of kidney function loss, but has not been investigated for ADPKD. This study aimed to obtain a first insight into whether DKK3 may indeed improve outcome prediction in ADPKD in the future.|Non-Cancer

ID:38281420|Title:Automatic detection of myocardial ischaemia using generalisable spatio-temporal hierarchical Bayesian modelling of DCE-MRI.Abstract:Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) can be used as a non-invasive method for the assessment of myocardial perfusion. The acquired images can be utilised to analyse the spatial extent and severity of myocardial ischaemia (regions with impaired microvascular blood flow). In the present paper, we propose a novel generalisable spatio-temporal hierarchical Bayesian model (GST-HBM) to automate the detection of ischaemic lesions and improve the in silico prediction accuracy by systematically integrating spatio-temporal context information. We present a computational inference procedure with an adequate trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, whereby model parameters are sampled from the posterior distribution with Gibbs sampling, while lower-level hyperparameters are selected using model selection strategies based on the Watanabe Akaike information criterion (WAIC). We have assessed our method on both synthetic (in silico) data with known gold-standard and 12 sets of clinical first-pass myocardial perfusion DCE-MRI datasets. We have also carried out a comparative performance evaluation with four established alternative methods: Gaussian mixture model (GMM), opening and closing operations based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM<sub>C&O</sub><sup>max</sup>), Markov random field constrained Gaussian mixture model (GMM-MRF) and model-based hierarchical Bayesian model (M-HBM). Our results show that the proposed GST-HBM method achieves much higher in silico prediction accuracy than the established alternative methods. Furthermore, this method appears to provide a more robust delineation of ischaemic lesions in datasets affected by spatially variant noise.|Non-Cancer

Here, to investigate whether human genetic variation underlies the heterogeneity of LASV infection, we carried out genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as well as seroprevalence surveys, human leukocyte antigen typing and high-throughput variant functional characterization assays. We analysed Lassa fever susceptibility and fatal outcomes in 533 cases of Lassa fever and 1,986 population controls recruited over a 7 year period in Nigeria and Sierra Leone. We detected genome-wide significant variant associations with Lassa fever fatal outcomes near GRM7 and LIF in the Nigerian cohort. We also show that a haplotype bearing signatures of positive selection and overlapping LARGE1, a required LASV entry factor, is associated with decreased risk of Lassa fever in the Nigerian cohort but not in the Sierra Leone cohort. Overall, we identified variants and genes that may impact the risk of severe Lassa fever, demonstrating how GWAS can provide insight into viral pathogenesis.|Non-Cancer

ID:38352583|Title:A unifying model to explain high nirmatrelvir therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, despite low post-exposure prophylaxis efficacy and frequent viral rebound.Abstract:In a pivotal trial (EPIC-HR), a 5-day course of oral ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, given early during symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (within three days of symptoms onset), decreased hospitalization and death by 89.1% and nasal viral load by 0.87 log relative to placebo in high-risk individuals. Yet, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir failed as post-exposure prophylaxis in a trial, and frequent viral rebound has been observed in subsequent cohorts. We developed a mathematical model capturing viral-immune dynamics and nirmatrelvir pharmacokinetics that recapitulated viral loads from this and another clinical trial (PLATCOV). Our results suggest that nirmatrelvir's <i>in vivo</i> potency is significantly lower than <i>in vitro</i> assays predict. According to our model, a maximally potent agent would reduce the viral load by approximately 3.5 logs relative to placebo at 5 days. The model identifies that earlier initiation and shorter treatment duration are key predictors of post-treatment rebound. Extension of treatment to 10 days for Omicron variant infection in vaccinated individuals, rather than increasing dose or dosing frequency, is predicted to lower the incidence of viral rebound significantly.|Non-Cancer

ID:38429495|Title:Digenic inheritance involving a muscle-specific protein kinase and the giant titin protein causes a skeletal muscle myopathy.Abstract:In digenic inheritance, pathogenic variants in two genes must be inherited together to cause disease. Only very few examples of digenic inheritance have been described in the neuromuscular disease field. Here we show that predicted deleterious variants in SRPK3, encoding the X-linked serine/argenine protein kinase 3, lead to a progressive early onset skeletal muscle myopathy only when in combination with heterozygous variants in the TTN gene. The co-occurrence of predicted deleterious SRPK3/TTN variants was not seen among 76,702 healthy male individuals, and statistical modeling strongly supported digenic inheritance as the best-fitting model. Furthermore, double-mutant zebrafish (srpk3<sup>-/-</sup>; ttn.1<sup>+/-</sup>) replicated the myopathic phenotype and showed myofibrillar disorganization. Transcriptome data suggest that the interaction of srpk3 and ttn.1 in zebrafish occurs at a post-transcriptional level. We propose that digenic inheritance of deleterious changes impacting both the protein kinase SRPK3 and the giant muscle protein titin causes a skeletal myopathy and might serve as a model for other genetic diseases.|Non-Cancer

ID:38441724|Title:Assessment of Autophagy in Leishmania Parasites.Abstract:Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by numerous species of Leishmania parasites, including Leishmania major. The parasite is transmitted by several species of sandfly vectors and infects myeloid cells leading to a myriad of inflammatory responses, immune dysregulations, and disease manifestations. Every cell undergoes autophagy, a self-regulated degradative process that permits the cells to recycle damaged or worn-out organelles in order to maintain cellular health and homeostasis. Studies have shown that Leishmania modulates their host cell autophagic machinery and there are indications that the parasite-specific autophagic processes may be valuable for parasite virulence and survival. However, the role of autophagy in Leishmania is inconclusive because of the limited tools available to study the Leishmania-specific autophagic machinery. Here, we describe methods to study and definitively confirm autophagy in Leishmania major. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allowed us to visualize Leishmania autophagosomes, especially those containing damaged mitochondrial content, as well as dividing mitochondria with ongoing fusion/fission processes. Flow cytometry enabled us to identify the amount of acridine orange dye accumulating in the acidic vacuolar compartments in Leishmania major by detecting fluorescence in the red laser when autophagic inhibitors or enhancers were included. These methods will advance studies that aim to understand autophagic regulation in Leishmania parasites that could provide insights into developing improved therapeutic targets against leishmaniasis.|Non-Cancer
ID:38463005|Title:Impaired polyamine metabolism causes behavioral and neuroanatomical defects in a mouse model of Snyder-Robinson syndrome.Abstract:Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS) is a rare X-linked recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the SMS gene, which encodes spermine synthase, and aberrant polyamine metabolism. SRS is characterized by intellectual disability, thin habitus, seizure, low muscle tone/hypotonia and osteoporosis. Progress towards understanding and treating SRS requires a model that recapitulates human gene variants and disease presentations. Here, we evaluated molecular and neurological presentations in the G56S mouse model, which carries a missense mutation in the Sms gene. The lack of SMS protein in the G56S mice resulted in increased spermidine/spermine ratio, failure to thrive, short stature and reduced bone density. They showed impaired learning capacity, increased anxiety, reduced mobility and heightened fear responses, accompanied by reduced total and regional brain volumes. Furthermore, impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was evident in G56S cerebral cortex, G56S fibroblasts and Sms-null hippocampal cells, indicating that SMS may serve as a future therapeutic target. Collectively, our study establishes the suitability of the G56S mice as a preclinical model for SRS and provides a set of molecular and functional outcome measures that can be used to evaluate therapeutic interventions for SRS.|Non-Cancer
ID:38480682|Title:Biallelic NAA60 variants with impaired n-terminal acetylation capacity cause autosomal recessive primary familial brain calcifications.Abstract:Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is characterized by calcium deposition in the brain, causing progressive movement disorders, psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive decline. PFBC is a heterogeneous disorder currently linked to variants in six different genes, but most patients remain genetically undiagnosed. Here, we identify biallelic NAA60 variants in ten individuals from seven families with autosomal recessive PFBC. The NAA60 variants lead to loss-of-function with lack of protein N-terminal (Nt)-acetylation activity. We show that the phosphate importer SLC20A2 is a substrate of NAA60 in vitro. In cells, loss of NAA60 caused reduced surface levels of SLC20A2 and a reduction in extracellular phosphate uptake. This study establishes NAA60 as a causal gene for PFBC, provides a possible biochemical explanation of its disease-causing mechanisms and underscores NAA60-mediated Nt-acetylation of transmembrane proteins as a fundamental process for healthy neurobiological functioning.|Non-Cancer
ID:38496508|Title:Deep sequencing of proteotoxicity modifier genes uncovers a Presenilin-2/beta-amyloid-actin genetic risk module shared among alpha-synucleinopathies.Abstract:Whether neurodegenerative diseases linked to misfolding of the same protein share genetic risk drivers or whether different protein-aggregation pathologies in neurodegeneration are mechanistically related remains uncertain. Conventional genetic analyses are underpowered to address these questions. Through careful selection of patients based on protein aggregation phenotype (rather than clinical diagnosis) we can increase statistical power to detect associated variants in a targeted set of genes that modify proteotoxicities. Genetic modifiers of alpha-synuclein (ɑS) and beta-amyloid (Aβ) cytotoxicity in yeast are enriched in risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), respectively. Here, along with known AD/PD risk genes, we deeply sequenced exomes of 430 ɑS/Aβ modifier genes in patients across alpha-synucleinopathies (PD, Lewy body dementia and multiple system atrophy). Beyond known PD genes <i>GBA1</i> and <i>LRRK2</i>, rare variants AD genes (<i>CD33</i>, <i>CR1</i> and <i>PSEN2</i>) and Aβ toxicity modifiers involved in RhoA/actin cytoskeleton regulation (<i>ARGHEF1, ARHGEF28, MICAL3, PASK, PKN2, PSEN2</i>) were shared risk factors across synucleinopathies. Actin pathology occurred in iPSC synucleinopathy models and RhoA downregulation exacerbated ɑS pathology. Even in sporadic PD, the expression of these genes was altered across CNS cell types. Genome-wide CRISPR screens revealed the essentiality of <i>PSEN2</i> in both human cortical and dopaminergic neurons, and <i>PSEN2</i> mutation carriers exhibited diffuse brainstem and cortical synucleinopathy independent of AD pathology. <i>PSEN2</i> contributes to a common-risk signal in PD GWAS and regulates ɑS expression in neurons. Our results identify convergent mechanisms across synucleinopathies, some shared with AD.|Non-Cancer

MT, OP, and saliva samples from symptomatic individuals in Atlanta, GA, in January 2022 and longitudinal samples from a small familial cohort were tested by both RT-PCR and ultrasensitive antigen assays. Higher concentrations in the nares were observed in the familial cohort, but a dominant sample type was not found among 39 cases in the cross-sectional cohort. The composite of positive MT or OP assay for both RT-PCR and antigen assay trended toward higher diagnostic yield but did not achieve significant difference. Our data did not identify a singular preferred sample type for SARS-CoV-2 testing, but higher levels of saliva nucleocapsid, a trend toward higher yield of composite OP/MT result, and association of apparent MT or OP predominance with symptoms warrant further study.|Non-Cancer
ID:38501195|Title:Rapid measurement of hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation by leveraging Bohr effect and Soret band bathochromic shift.Abstract:Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) binds to hemoglobin (Hb) in the lungs and is then released (dissociated) in the tissues. The Bohr effect is a physiological mechanism that governs the affinity of Hb for O<sub>2</sub> based on pH, where a lower pH results in a lower Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity and higher Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation. Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity and dissociation are crucial for maintaining aerobic metabolism in cells and tissues. Despite its vital role in human physiology, Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement is underutilized in basic research and in clinical laboratories, primarily due to the technical complexity and limited throughput of existing methods. We present a rapid Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement approach by leveraging the Bohr effect and detecting the optical shift in the Soret band that corresponds to the light absorption by the heme group in Hb. This new method reduces Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement time from hours to minutes. We show that Hb deoxygenation can be accelerated chemically at the optimal pH of 6.9. We show that time and pH-controlled deoxygenation of Hb results in rapid and distinct conformational changes in its tertiary structure. These molecular conformational changes are manifested as significant, detectable shifts in Hb's optical absorption spectrum, particularly in the characteristic Soret band (414 nm). We extensively validated the method by testing human blood samples containing normal Hb and Hb variants. We show that rapid Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation can be used to screen for and detect Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity disorders and to evaluate the function and efficacy of Hb-modifying therapies. The ubiquity of optical absorption spectrophotometers positions this approach as an accessible, rapid, and accurate Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation measurement method for basic research and clinical use. We anticipate this method's broad adoption will democratize the diagnosis and prognosis of Hb disorders, such as sickle cell disease. Further, this method has the potential to transform the research and development of new targeted and genome-editing-based therapies that aim to modify or improve Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity.|Non-Cancer
ID:38502483|Title:High-Throughput RNA-HCR-FISH Detection of Endogenous Pre-mRNA Splice Variants.Abstract:RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) is an essential and widely used tool for visualizing RNA molecules in intact cells. Recent advances have increased RNA-FISH sensitivity, signal detection efficiency, and throughput. However, detection of endogenous mRNA splice variants has been challenging due to the limits of visualization of RNA-FISH fluorescence signals and due to the limited number of RNA-FISH probes per target. HiFENS (high-throughput FISH detection of endogenous pre-mRNA splicing isoforms) is a method that enables visualization and relative quantification of mRNA splice variants at single-cell resolution in an automated high-throughput manner. HiFENS incorporates HCR (hybridization chain reaction) signal amplification strategies to enhance the fluorescence signal generated by low abundance transcripts or a small number of FISH probes targeting short stretches of RNA, such as single exons. The technique offers a significant advance in high-throughput FISH-based RNA detection and provides a powerful tool that can be used as a readout in functional genomics screens to discover and dissect cellular pathways regulating gene expression and alternative pre-mRNA splicing events.|Non-Cancer

ID:38530241|Title:Functional diversity of NLRP3 gain-of-function mutants associated with CAPS autoinflammation.Abstract:NLRP3-associated autoinflammatory disease is a heterogenous group of monogenic conditions caused by NLRP3 gain-of-function mutations. The poor functional characterization of most NLRP3 variants hinders diagnosis despite efficient anti-IL-1 treatments. Additionally, while NLRP3 is controlled by priming and activation signals, gain-of-functions have only been investigated in response to priming. Here, we characterize 34 NLRP3 variants in vitro, evaluating their activity upon induction, priming, and/or activation signals, and their sensitivity to four inhibitors. We highlight the functional diversity of the gain-of-function mutants and describe four groups based on the signals governing their activation, correlating partly with the symptom severity. We identify a new group of NLRP3 mutants responding to the activation signal without priming, associated with frequent misdiagnoses. Our results identify key NLRP3 residues controlling inflammasome activity and sensitivity to inhibitors, and antagonistic mechanisms with broader efficacy for therapeutic strategies. They provide new insights into NLRP3 activation, an explanatory mechanism for NLRP3-AID heterogeneity, and original tools for NLRP3-AID diagnosis and drug development.|Non-Cancer
ID:38539243|Title:A systematic review of progranulin concentrations in biofluids in over 7,000 people-assessing the pathogenicity of GRN mutations and other influencing factors.Abstract:Pathogenic heterozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) are a key cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), leading to significantly reduced biofluid concentrations of the progranulin protein (PGRN). This has led to a number of ongoing therapeutic trials aiming to treat this form of FTD by increasing PGRN levels in mutation carriers. However, we currently lack a complete understanding of factors that affect PGRN levels and potential variation in measurement methods. Here, we aimed to address this gap in knowledge by systematically reviewing published literature on biofluid PGRN concentrations.|Non-Cancer

ID:38583503|Title:Transcriptome and Metabolome analysis reveal HFPO-TA induced disorders of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in rat by interfering with PPAR signaling pathway.Abstract:PFOA is one of the most representative compounds in the family of perfluorinated organic compounds. Due to its varying toxicity, alternatives to PFOA are beginning to emerge. HFPO-TA is an alternative for PFOA. It is currently unclear whether HFPO-TA affects glucose and lipid metabolism. In this study, rats were used as an animal model to investigate the effects of HFPO-TA on liver glucose and lipid metabolism. We found that HFPO-TA can affect glucose tolerance. Through omics analysis and molecular detection, it was found that HFPO-TA mainly affects the PPAR signaling pathway in the liver of rats, inhibiting liver glycolysis while promoting glucose production. HFPO-TA not only promotes the synthesis of fatty acids in the liver, but also promotes the breakdown of fatty acids, which ultimately leads to the disruption of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. The effects of HFPO-TA on metabolism are discussed in this paper to provide a reference for the risk assessment of this PFOA substitute.|Non-Cancer
ID:38593120|Title:Early antiretroviral therapy in SIV-infected rhesus macaques reveals a multiphasic, saturable dynamic accumulation of the rebound competent viral reservoir.Abstract:The rebound competent viral reservoir (RCVR)-virus that persists during antiretroviral treatment (ART) and can reignite systemic infection when treatment is stopped-is the primary barrier to eradicating HIV. We used time to initiation of ART during primary infection of rhesus macaques (RMs) after intravenous challenge with barcoded SIVmac239 as a means to elucidate the dynamics of RCVR establishment in groups of RMs by creating a multi-log range of pre-ART viral loads and then assessed viral time-to-rebound and reactivation rates resulting from the discontinuation of ART after one year. RMs started on ART on days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 or 12 post-infection showed a nearly 10-fold difference in pre-ART viral measurements for successive ART-initiation timepoints. Only 1 of 8 RMs initiating ART on days 3 and 4 rebounded after ART interruption despite measurable pre-ART plasma viremia. Rebounding plasma from the 1 rebounding RM contained only a single barcode lineage detected at day 50 post-ART. All RMs starting ART on days 5 and 6 rebounded between 14- and 50-days post-ART with 1-2 rebounding variants each. RMs starting ART on days 7, 9, and 12 had similar time-to-measurable plasma rebound kinetics despite multiple log differences in pre-ART plasma viral load (pVL), with all RMs rebounding between 7- and 16-days post-ART with 3-28 rebounding lineages. Calculated reactivation rates per pre-ART pVL were highest for RMs starting ART on days 5, 6, and 7 after which the rate of accumulation of the RCVR markedly decreased for RMs treated on days 9 and 12, consistent with multiphasic establishment and near saturation of the RCVR within 2 weeks post infection. Taken together, these data highlight the heterogeneity of the RCVR between RMs, the stochastic establishment of the very early RCVR, and the saturability of the RCVR prior to peak viral infection.|Non-Cancer

ID:38701783|Title:FLT3L governs the development of partially overlapping hematopoietic lineages in humans and mice.Abstract:FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L), encoded by FLT3LG, is a hematopoietic factor essential for the development of natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) in mice. We describe three humans homozygous for a loss-of-function FLT3LG variant with a history of various recurrent infections, including severe cutaneous warts. The patients' bone marrow (BM) was hypoplastic, with low levels of hematopoietic progenitors, particularly myeloid and B cell precursors. Counts of B cells, monocytes, and DCs were low in the patients' blood, whereas the other blood subsets, including NK cells, were affected only moderately, if at all. The patients had normal counts of Langerhans cells (LCs) and dermal macrophages in the skin but lacked dermal DCs. Thus, FLT3L is required for B cell and DC development in mice and humans. However, unlike its murine counterpart, human FLT3L is required for the development of monocytes but not NK cells.|Non-Cancer
